review
My favorite wings around.  I found this place in college and I've been going here ever since.  Whenever I'm in the chicagoland area I make sure to hit this place up.  There is nothing magical about the restaurant except for the wings.  The restaurant itself is just a walk in storefront.  Food is walk up to order.  A few places to sit in the back.  Service is simple.. not much.Wings are awesome.  Several different spice levels.  Full of vinegar goodness.  I love these wings.Give this place a try if you love wings!
"I thought it was pretty good. It's been awhile since I've been to any Buffalo Joe's and I don't think I've been to this one. This is a low down greasy wing place which isn't a criticism. It's true homemade wings and sauce. While o think it's a little on the expensive side, you do get a pretty generous order of wings. I thought their spicy was going to be hotter. I guess I need to try the suicide flavor. The biggest surprise were the waffle fries. Nice and crunchy with some seasoning (pepper?). Complemented the wings and was awesome dipped in said sauce. While people have complained about the service, they treated me quite well, especially since I didn't know what I was doing. The woman who took my order was so helpful! Sometimes you just want wings. This is the place for some down and dirty wings made with love. I'll probably be back, but you gotta bring cash!"
"I used to love Buffjoes in my teens and 20's, I think it was maybe 10 years or more since I last had it. And I gotta say, it has not changed at all. The suicide sauce is still FUEGO. The suicide sauce has my heart. It's not that spicy, but has all the flava. And cheddar chips are a necessity. The inside has not changed in the last 20 years. You order at one end of the counter, then wait for your food. Once your food's ready, pay at the register. Grab an oatmeal chocochip cookie if you can! Parking in the area is usually not too difficult. Oh and bring cash! They're cash only, but they do have an atm inside."
"A friend of mind introduced me Buffalo Joes! I have to say I am highly happy that he did. Let me get into it!Food: Hands down the best chicken wings! The flavor and the freshness was great! Each time I have come I always feel satisfied. Service: The speed of how quickly the food comes out and how the cashier is very chatty and how they walk you thought the menu is great. Atmosphere: Or ambiance like I call it, the decor really matched the shop vibe! I really like walking in as it makes me feel I am going back in time. Overall, I would visit Buffalo Joes any time I am in the area. I love the food and how friendly everyone is."
"I just came back to buff joes after a several year hiatus. Wings: top notch. Excellent. Worth the long wait time. Freshly fried, tender, juicy and super flavorful. Fries: waffle fries. Can get with or without cheese. Cheese sauce is super thick - maybe not in a good way lol.Service: quick, not especially friendly, though the food more than makes up for it! Cash only. Long wait times. Ambience: worn out interior. Tables with benches. Avoid sitting too close to the restrooms as the cleaning solution scent is off putting."
The best wings in the entire world. Been coming here since around 2004. Never fails. Best sauce. Love the small crispy wings. Never change buff joes.
Really not my go to for wings ordered from her one time for lunch at work and I was disappointed small ass wings
Haven't been here in over a year. Street parking only. Went around 7pm Wednesday they had a few spots right in front. It's cash only they have a atm inside. The place could use a remodel. The men's bathroom was out of order with a strong sewer smell coming out of it. Good and quick service. We ordered buffalo chips and double order spicy (wings). Sauce taste great as usual but the wings were on the small side compared to last time. The Buffalo sauce just taste so good. I'll be back!
"I was ridiculously determined and excited to try this place. Literally burned half a day on my short vacay to come here. I didn't order ahead and the cashier almost tried to dissuade me from ordering. I literally flew across the country to come here so I was staying. The wait was less than they stated so I was glad for that! But the food. Wow. Worst wings I have ever had. Very average cook, but the sauce. Borderline GROSS. It was gloopy and smelled weird. ""Suicide"" sauce was the blandest, mildest sauce ever. I've had THOUSANDS of wings all over the US and these were horrible. So annoyed I wasted so much time going there. For $26 I tried to eat as much as I could suffer through and then just threw it all away. Felt gross all the way back to the hotel. Grosssssssssss."
"Buffalo Joes is so good, I wish they opened until midnight. The chicken is so good, and whenever I crave a nice hearty burger, they deliver so well! Also, it's cash only, but the price is so good for the quality and amount of food. Everything here is so good and the people inside are super nice. They also prepare the food really quickly! Definitely recommend :)"
"I've been coming here since I was a little kid and honestly it's the place to go for wings! They have other menu items, but really most people get the wings. I most recently ordered both mild and spicy and loved both. The sauce doesn't have a super vinegary flavor like some places and it is well balanced. Even the spicy wasn't too spicy for me. The chips aka fries pair nicely with the wings. The wings themselves are on the smaller side and fried to perfection. Nice and crispy. The celery came with them and it was a nice palate cleanser. Don't expect much from the interior here, but come for some of the best wings. It is cash only."
"This place is cash only but has an ATM inside. The inside doesn't look much. Definitely has fast food joint vibe. We ordered at the counter and when our food was ready we paid with the cashier. Ordered the spicy Buffalo wings and waffle fries. Wings are crispy, saucy and delicious. Definitely had an amazing heat level for the spicy lovers. Fries are definitely nicely crispy, crunchy and salty. Prefect combination with the wings. I definitely need to try some of the other sauce they have available."
"This is a home town staple. Hubby and I go to Chicago twice a year from California. When we were looking for some thing to eat, my husband said how about Buffalo Joe's. As I looked at him, he says I am drooling right now. Just thinking about it. So we went. It wasn't as busy as we anticipated but the surprising thing is one of the workers was still there, a bit older, he's been around since I was working in a salon in downtown Evanston many moons ago. We ordered a double order, medium spice with a side of cheddar chips. It was really really good and just brought back memories from high school. However, since I am 25 years older, I definitely felt the heartburn the next day. Though the memories are still fresh in my mind my stomach lining is definitely a lot older. Great place to be."
Best wings in the world. My go to anytime I come home. Never changes and the vibes are great.
"I would like to publicly say that these are the BEST wings I've ever laid my mouth on. I literally travel 45 mins for these wings. My family and I needs Buffalo Joe's to sponsor us. We eat these wings 3 times a week. When I say FYE & cooked to perfection, I'm notLying. Service is SUPERB!  DEF RECOMMEND! 5 stars"
"This was my second time to Buff Joe's and it was great! The service was fast, efficient, and they make sure you get your food quick! The wings were crispy, and the sauce on the wings is nothing like I've ever had before. I really can't describe what it tastes like but it's a spin off on Buffalo Sauce. It has a hint of pepper in the sauce that makes Buff Joe's so unique.I would go back in a heartbeat and get the wings again. The waffle fries have a fantastic crunch to them and pair well as a side. Some of the wings are on the smaller size but with the chicken wing shortage it's not surprising. If you're looking for some top notch wings, this is the place to go!"
They have MASTERED Buffalo wings. Their spicy buffalo sauce is SOOO good. I will drive 40 min to the Evanston location from downtown and have no regrets. The orders are made pretty fast and the wings are on the smaller side but they give you a lot. And the waffle fries are good too! Generous amount given there too. Only downside is the place is cash-only but worth taking out cash for.
come here if you want the best wings and chic chip oatmeal cookies. These wings are amazing! Dean and staff are always taking care of customers
This place has been here for decades. They make the wings in front you so it's always hot and fresh. The suicide flavor is the best and jalapeños make it extra kick
"Rib tips- the rib tips are AMAZING! The prices aren't bad and they give you ALOT of food.  Shrimp- my God they're HUGE and good. Draw back: they only accept cash, but they have an ATM in the store."
"First and last time to visit. Place is dirty and the staff/cashier were eating while working and licking fingers then touching food. Wait was long, so we got to observe the stomach turning display of the help."
"There's a reason buff joes is award winning and it's their sauce. The vinegary, spicy buffalo sauce is to die for and unique from the everyday buffalo sauce you'll find elsewhere. The GM, dean is a great guy beloved by the community and been there forever.  The wings are on the smaller end but a single order with waffle fries is plenty enough food that won't make you feel bloated after and comes out to around $16 nowadays. (Inflation and such). There's only one thing to get at buff joes and it's their spicy wings and if you feel crazy, suicide wings with the jalapeños on top. Pro-tip: come with cash because it is a cash only establishment"
GO HERE!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!! Been going here for 33+ Years!! Great service! Very friendly! Consistent! Best wings around for sure!! GO HERE!!
"Stopped here to grab a bit to eat on our way to Glacier National Park and were very impressed with the delicious food, western decor and fantastic service!"
"Have Wings, Will Travel I asked someone who lived in Evanston what food they missed the most and they mentioned Buffalo wingsBuffalo Joe's takes the original wings recipe and brings the signature spicy and tangy flavor to the MidwestThe affordable order has long been a campus favorite and I was glad to finally try authentic Buffalo wings...freshly deep fried and a strong vinegary sauceI found the spice level mild but they also have BBQ and suicide spicy levels Single Order, Mild $10.99 and Single Order, Spicy Buffalo Wings $10.99Buffalo Joe's (Evanston, IL)Buffalo Joe's accepts CASH only."
"With my boyfriend claiming his last meal on Earth would be Buffalo Joe's, I had high expectations for this joint.  And Buff Joe's delivered!Definitely my favorite buffalo flavored meal, since their sauce isn't crazy strong and has more of a cheesy flavor.  The chicken patty is fried with a thin coating and not a crunchy (or soggy but thick) shell of batter, doused in the sauce, and perched on a bed of lettuce and tomatoes.  The hamburger bun is nothing special, so all the magic was the chicken and the sauce!  I think taking the tomatoes out helps you taste more of the flavor but that's just me (and everyone else in my group)!  The the meat was tender and so, so good. The fries were ahhhh-mazing.  Even though the waffle fries really crispy at all, the salt and pepper seasoning combo was addicting! Definitely not the healthiest choice, but a combo of their sandwich and seasoned fries is definitely a new favorite of mine :D  they also have a bunch of other items like award-winning chili-- check them out for some Om nom noms!"
"Ordered: grilled chicken salad, no carrots;  dressing: blue cheese. Received: ranch, tons of carrots. Ordered: grilled chicken sandwich (comes w/lettuce, tomato and mayo by default) specifically as a lettuce wrap, no bun. Extra mayo on the side. Received: mayo-less bread bun - can these culinary geniuses read? - chicken breast w/no tomato. No mayo on the side. Even as a regular sandwich, it would be woefully incorrect. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, until I was able to receive a refund per Grubhub. Please stay in school."
"I took a flight from California for food only! I will be headed back at 9am in the morning.  I came here only for Pan of suicide wings to be lead to think they close at 11pm . I called this location from Howard Street location and they wouldn't take my order. I explained the situation and the young girl wouldn't take my order saying. "" we're cleaning"". I extremely saddened bcuz they won't be open before my flight leave in the morning.  Surprise they wouldn't accommodate me"
It's a staple in Evanston but has fallen flat. The food isn't what it use to be. The prices are higher and the the wings are smaller. They have a demographic they cater to.
"The wings are hand down the best! They were cooked, seasoned and sauced to perfection. I would come back if I was closer. It's easier to eat inside if you do not live close. It's cash only. The burger was disgusting. They should consider doing wings only. Will be back for sure. The service was cool."
"service is trash, these people don't ever care don't listen and always mess your order. if it wasn't for how delicious the wings are I woild never come to this mediocre place. Ambiance is your typical fast food restaurant not a first date kinda place."
Every time I'm in Evanston Buffalo Joe's is a must. Suicide wings and cheddar waffle fries are the staple and they are done so well! Cash only FYI
Here's why.....Chicken had a bad odor when I bit into it. Their Buffalo sauce has absolutely no flavor.  Their ranch sauce was definitely not ranch. Waffles fries were old. I was so excited to try this place out.  I would never go back. Also management should enforce employees to tie their hair back when making food. -do not recommend
"My favorite wings in the Chicago area no doubt but it has become the Spirit Airlines of wing joints in the last decade or so that I've been eating there.Raising prices is only natural, plus with the supply chain issues surrounding meat and the tight labor market it is a absolutely necessary to stay alive. I get it.Last year they stopped offering tap water. Annoying but I get that too. Drinks are a core piece of margin and profitability in every restaurant, and without them the owner will either be forced to charge you more for the food, or decrease the quality in an effort to maintain price. Only thing is Buff Joe's has both increased the price, shrank the food, and makes you pay for water but again, it's a tough time in a tough industry. Also, contrary to popular belief, it is only illegal for a restaurant to refuse serving free water if they sell alcohol; Buff Joe's does not.Cash only in an increasingly cashless world. I get it, why would you want to pay 1.87% to Visa and MasterCard when you can instead earn a fee off the ATM machine. Not sure how places like this don't get audited all the time but whatever, it is what it is.As for the place itself I personally like it the way it is and don't want it to change. Okay maybe the restroom is a bit gross and I guess they could do a bit better of a job wiping down tables given COVID but honestly, it's all part of the experience.And finally, they stopped providing wet naps during the pandemic. That's where I drawn the line. Like COME ON! Really? It's a wing restaurant. Charge me a quarter if you must but don't not have em. It's absolutely ridiculous. It is $22.59 for a double order that is the same amount of food as a single order everywhere else, which really means it is $25 with tip before you even order fries, a drink, or anything else and you can't offer wet naps anymore????? This is where it's really starts to feel like Spirit Airlines. The rest of it makes sense and is a product of unfortunate realities, but taking the wet naps away borders on robbing the customers of their dignity. I hate sounding like a 'Karen' but it's true."
I write this review with great respect. I start by saying I've been going to BJs since 1994.  The food was always consistent hot and good. I am sad to say my recent visit which takes me one hour drive. The wings was not hot but even more the wings are the size of a female pinky finger. I am sad to say It's a no for me.
they always good when i go but the last time i went i was a lil disappointed but the service was good and hospitable like always but the size of the chicken wings had me pissed lookin like lil strong ass pit bull arms. get them wings back down to normal size i was happy wit the size but yall always good. get it together
"The food is consistently good and the staff is friendly and inviting. Cashier by the name of ""Mercedes"" is always greeting me and providing me with the best customer service!"
"It's a hit and miss, you would think for a place specializing in wings, the quality of the product would be better, don't even call and complain, you're not getting a refund, very bad business practices."
"I would have given them a 5, because the taste is still there, but it seems as if their wings keep getting smaller. I swear I can probably finish a party pan by myself. In fact I probably almost have, lol. Get some bigger wings."
"Buff Joe's is the best wing place I've ever had!! Tbh do not get anything other than the wings (it's still fairly good) but the wings are what you want to come here for! Trust me when I say, get the mild barbecue mix flavor! It isn't really spicy, but it has a good flavor kick! It is absolutely phenomenal. Coming from California, I've had my fair share of wings. This place tops them all! The service is mediocre & the place isn't the nicest, but none of that matters when you have the best wings ever!This is a must have when visiting Chicago!!"
"It's a no frills place but they do good wings! We had a single order of wings, and it's probably up there for top buffalo wings I've had."
"The sauce, the sauce, the sauce!! These wings are so delicious because of the sauce. It is cash ONLY! so come prepared. I've tried the suicide and it is too spicy for me to handle but you can definitely appreciate the flavors even though the spice stays on your tongue. BBQ has a ring to it as well so I play it safe and always get mild."
Always one of my favorites!! Absolutely love Buffalo Joes.Mixed bbq and mild easy sauce every time
"Buffalo Joe's is legendary!!!  The wings are amazing, the sauce is delicious!  The atmosphere is that of a college town wing spot and the service is outstanding!!!  5 Stars all day eeer' day!"
"Bring cash and get ready to experience an amazing set of wings. If you like spicy, order the suicide wings. Don't worry, it's not as blazing hot as you'd think - it's just amaZING!!"
"Being an alumni to a local university here, I have a lot of nostalgia for this place.That being said, I only order one thing when I'm here - and it's the waffle fries hahaha. The wings are usually good too, but man, I just love them filling up an entire bag of fries for $2. Maybe it's my smile, but I just really love the fries.Buff Joe's has a lot of charm to it too. Their workers have personality and gusto, so it feels more lively than maybe a Chipotle or one of those new bougie acai bowl places. Maybe not for everyone, but there for people who know :)So yeah, the waffle fries, charm, and I guess the buffalo wings make this joint pretty much integral to Evanston. Can't imagine the place without it!"
"I should really give it a 3.5 but can't. Our kids love their wings, and the waffle fries are great (although our most-recent order should have been cooked more; they were soft). This is a classic, greasy, spicy meal, and you're going to need some wet wipes or at least a lot of napkins. I'd love to see them ditch the styrofoam take-out containers, but that doesn't affect my rating. Cash only, so hit the ATM."
"Excellent wings! Best I've had. We ordered the traditional buffalo sauce that has a certain soft grit that holds this burst of flavor.  On your first bite it affirms this is something special. I would have liked to be able to split the sauces they only have two kinds but even at a double order of 20 wings, I was not allowed to do so. Because of Covid it's take out only. Why 4 stars? There was a certain lethargy with taking the phone order  and difficulty in spelling my name. Then when  my wife came to pick it up the wings which were ready, she was delayed because it took time for them to get the 2 fountain drinks."
"Truly a 3 but added one star for the price. honestly, this place needs to be revamped.Everything I touched felt like it's never been cleaned before. The bathroom was appalling so don't go in there if you want to have an appetite. None of the workers seem to like their job either but again,The Wow factor here is the price!!!!The sauces for the wings we ordered were good.Hot, bbq, and hot bbq.Orders come with celery.And we got fries with the cheese on the side, which is the best idea bc the cheese hardens and does not appear as appetizing.No free water here, No card payment either. There is an atm by register though! There is one small television."
We ordered a mild party pan and a double spicy. We've been coming here for years and the wings were amazing. Had a side of waffle fries with cheese and an RC Cola. Best in town.

"So good! My boyfriend and I walked in and ordered suicide wings and waffle fries. We didn't have to wait that long for our food and it really hit the spot. The wings were juicy, good size, crisp, and drenched in sauce, as they should be. There's something about the buffalo sauce that's just so good especially with the ranch. Even though they're called suicide wings, it wasn't deadly spicy and I'm not great with spice. The waffle fries were okay to me, I've had better but they're a good side.My only complaints is that the place was a little dirty and hot on a summer day. They only take cash which can be inconvenient, but just keep that in mind when you go. But definitely still worth the try if you're in the area!"
"Ho hum. Had wings and cheddar burger. Burger ok, fresh ingredients, good grilled flavor. Wings mediocre, not bad not inspiring. Waffle fries were delicious."
"I'm not a wings person, and these were by far the best wings I've ever had. They converted me into a wings person! We ordered for takeout multiple times and have always had a great experience with the staff in terms of accuracy, packaging, and timeliness. Definitely recommend!"
"This is a quiet, unassuming local joint. Came here with a friend and ordered a Buffalo chicken sandwich. I enjoyed the sandwich - chicken was nice and crispy with a tasty bun (5/5). However, I felt that the interior of the restaurant could use some TLC. Next time I will probably get my food to go."
"Customers for many years, always ordering the same thing. Either a fish and chips or rib tips. I know what I like. The employee argued that I didn't order a double dish and chips and explained how the fish and chips either come with or without fries. The chips are the fries. It would just be fish if I didn't order fries. It's on your menu as either fish OR fish and chips.Look and your menu and my receipt before telling me what I didn't order. Just so disappointed in their customer service as of lately. It's on the receipt. I'm not trying to steal a dollars work of fries."
"Fun, casual dining. Quick service, except when crowded, which it often is. No frills."
"Terrrible customer service!! I can't even comment on the food because I've never gotten to even order. Every time I've been there, there's an insane wait, only one guy running back and forth between the indoor area and the outdoor take out patio, and I've never gotten my order taken down. Also, when I call theyre always busy!! I wanna get the wings and leave a real food review!"
"Quick | Cash | WingsQuick: Buffalo Joe's is quick and tasty bar food. You can call in and your order will be ready 15-20 minutes later or you can walk in and order and wait about 5-10 minutes.  The restaurant really isn't designed for you to stay and have a meal. Although they have a seating area that can hold 40ish people, it's designed to be a take-out spot. Cash: the business is cash only so make sure you stop by an ATM on your way over. If you forget they have a few ATMs on the block. Wings: you have to get the wings. They have a variety of flavors but my favorites are hot and bbq. You can split your order into two flavors if you like.  They measure them by the pound but given the price point they are a real few. For 10 dollars (with tax) you get between 12-15 wings in a single order.  They come with celery sticks (6-10). Pro Tip: No northwestern student discount"
It's really nothing special. Wings are barely ok. I guess the waffle fries are awesome so that's something. Venue is pretty lame. Feels like I'm in a Wendy's in 1986.
"We love their food but the pan costs have been terribly questionable recently. A single pan order is already $77, if they're including the sales tax, the the total cost shouldn't be more than $85 in all. If I give $100, why am i getting only $5 back in change??? And where's my receipt??? No receipt to explain the extra charges??? Yeah, someone's helping themselves. Been loyal for years. Never coming back again."
"Just had their famous wings and yum- so good! Want to give a shout out to the ladies handling the orders.  Despite crazy Super Bowl weekend and so much going on there, they handled the crowd coming in to order with such grace and calmness.  They were so pleasant. Everyone behind the counter looked like they were having a good time.  Thanks for such a great dining experience!"
"It's been awhile since I had Buffalo Joes and was really excited to tried it again.  Worst Wings ever.  The wings were old and definitely not fresh, the fries were horrible as well.  For the price not worth it would never go back."
I've been going to Buffalo Joe's for nearly 30 years! I rate their wings as # one of the world. Spicy or suicide are my favorites. Their cheese fries are amazing. Don't forget to order extra sides of celery sticks and sauce. Friendly and dedicated work staff. Great urban atmosphere.
There was a giant hair in the bottom of our bbq wings. Probably will not try this place again since the quality of wings did not make up for it. I was pretty excited to try this place since I've heard lots of good things. But was pretty disappointed - might have come in with too high of expectations. We ordered the spicy and the bbq. Their style of buffalo is tasty but the spicy had basically no spice. But the wings were prepped pretty whatever. The outside didn't have a good texture and the sauce made them pretty soggy. The bbq sauce was also nothing special. Very mediocre wings for the hype.
"Gosh.  I haven't been here since my college days.  I keep a very healthy diet.  However, I treat myself once in a blue moon.  Today is Joe's Wings and Villa's thin crust.  I feel no shame!The menu remained the same after all these years.  My typical order back in the the day was a double suicide.  Sine I have others to consider, I opted for spicy.  (They do sell different level of spicy sauce on the side).Although they are famous for their wings, they do have burgers, Italian beef, hot dogs and your typical fast food items on their menu.  The also sell tray size wings for your next party.This is a cash only establishment.  They do have an ATM machine by the cash register.Everyone staff member I encountered today was friendly and courteous.  I would definitely keep Joe's in mind for next blue moon."
"Buffalo Joes may be one of the best things about living in Evanston! I wish I had know about this place much sooner! Right now its takeout for everything and super easy to call ahead to place your order. This place is a steal in terms of the cost for everything and how good everything taste! Plus you get so much food with each item! We really really love their wings! They come in a few flavors from not spicy to very spicy! They are drenched in sauce and come in a gigantic package. You also get some veggies and dip with the dish. We also are obsessed with all of their burgers! They have toppings including cheese, bbq sauce, and their special sauce. All of it is soooo good! The burger itself is HUGE and not shy of flavor. Plus its less then 10 dollars so great for a budget! Honestly, this could be the best burger in town. Do note that they are cash only!"
"I wish I knew about this place MONTHS AGO. It is by far the cheapest bar food in the area. Cash only which is a bit frustrating but worth the hassle. You can easily call ahead and wait outside for your foods. they have typical bar foods, but all at much cheaper prices. We have tried their mild wings which were very tasty, full of flavor and had so much sauce. Plus it felt like there was triple the amount that there usually is for wings. Also, tried a few different burgers...for under $7 they are MASSIVE and almost hard to finish there is so much to eat. They are super super juice, packed with flavor, and worth the mess. The burgers are probably my favorite thing here. Lastly, we tried a hot dog...this was disappointing as it came with no toppings when we asked for all. Nonetheless, it is still a great place to go if you want cheap and tasty food."
Just received my single order. What is going on with their wings? They just keep getting smaller and smaller! These look like frog legs. To top it off they barely even put any wings in this single order. They should have at least put more wings if they're going to put these tiny wings in them. Buffalo joes..this is pathetic!
My every other Friday night meal. Love the bbq and the seasoned fries. The chicken gumbo at the Clark restaurant was really. Try the fish sandwich it is good
Dropped in becuz my grandson loves this place.  The wings were definitely good fried perfectly.  We had the waffle fries which were also good but could have been fried a little longer.  It's all cash and they weren't serving beer. the drink options were very limited.
These are absolutely the best wings I've ever had I cannot say enough about this place there so consistent in being awesome with good prices anything you order here is delicious come for the food and leave happy that's it
Best wings in state I eat here like twice a week forget atmosphere if you want the best wings Chicago has to offer you found it
"My husband and I just came back from this AMAZING place. He told me that he used to go there during his high school years (he's 40 now), he was so happy for being back now that we live out of state. It was my first time there since I am not from the USA and OMGOSH! These are the BEST wings I have ever tasted!  Also, the entire crew are FANTASTIC, so friendly, kind, and patient! We left the place with a huge smile, not only because of the amazing food but because of the amazing personnel. Next visit we will stop by for sure."
"If you live in the suburbs, there is no other place to look other than Buffalo Joe's (Buff Joe's). The sauces are the most flavorful wing sauces I have ever had and the chicken is crispy. Even though COVID has limited in door dining, they still have lines out the door in freezing temperatures! So worth the wait in line and the drive home, almost pulled over to get into the wings but waited for a proper napkin set up haha. You won't be disappointed - go for the hottest they offer!"
"The food is good but the customer service experience is terrible. The first time I went there the girl came out because they don't allow anyone inside which is fine since it's Covid.  She asked if I was picking up and I told her I wanted to order food and she told me that I had to call to order. I got back into my car and called and the same girl answered, I don't know why she couldn't just take my order when we were talking outside. Then yesterday my cousin called and the girl on the phone was extremely rude. My cousin asked her a question on the menu and she was answering back sarcastically so my cousin asked her to repeat what she was questioning and the person on the phone got even more mad because she was trying to get a clear answer. We are paying customers and we don't go there all the time, why would you talk to a customer like a nobody who isn't even doing anything wrong? When she finished taking our order, my cousin asked how long will it take since we were on the road driving 25 minutes away and she says, ""right now."" That's just ridiculous, because you know if we were right there and asked for our order, it wouldn't be done at that moment. And to top it off, she got our order wrong. Seriously, you have one job, why is it so hard to get it right? The food is delicious, but having to deal with people who don't know how to do their job and treat their customers right, doesn't make us want to go back. Why would you want to push your customers away, instead of bringing business in? It's beyond me. They need to work on their customer service. For now, because of such unsatisfactory customer service, I give a 1 star rating. Making your customer feel dumb isn't a vibe. When all I want to do is order food to eat and be happy, not annoyed."
Best wings in the entire Chicago area. Spicy wings with the waffle cheese fries. Fire.
"It is cash only, but so worth it. These wings are a staple in Evanston. You will not find any better wings in downtown Evanston. They are perfectly cooked every time, the sauce is amazing."
"Once upon a time in the 80's, this was a go-to place for wings, a good burger, corn on the cob with waffle fries to share with friends.  Those were the glory days.  Now, it is an unfortunate mess; run-down to just borderline gross.  Think old urban gas station bathroom (yes, this is also gross). with dining area to match.  It's upkeep has probably been this neglected for years since it's glory days.  The employees were busy toiling away, but seemed as run down and unhappy as the place.   Not a friendly smile amongst them.  Yeah, but the food. I can't speak for the wings, but if they didn't change the recipe, they are probably still good.  The burger I ordered was slim with lots of bun (decent bun) and what one would expect on a burger.  I couldn't bring myself to consume it.  Fries were not good tasting of old oil.  Maybe they do a swift takeout business? Definitely NOT a dine in place for me again.  If they are trying to give the old throwback feel, they have succeeded.  I mean, that is why I returned, to see that some things hadn't changed over the decades.  Maybe it's better to let some college memories be just that, memories.  Without a serious scrubbing, gut rehab and overhaul,  I will not be returning."
"Great spot for quick and tasty wings. It's a very casual setting but the wings are good. These aren't necessarily the best buffalo wings I've ever had, but they are tasty for sure.We got a double order and it probably came with 20-25 wings. It was a lot haha but we ate them all! We got the mild flavor and it tastes a little bit different from a typical buffalo sauce; these seem tangier and have more of a tomato flavor. I like it! They come with some celery sticks which is nice.This place is also cash only which is a bit of an inconvenience. Overall it's a decent spot if you're just looking for a quick spot to grab some tasty wings."
I don't even eat wings but this place gets 5 stars alone for their cheddar chips. Careful- the place on Howard has cheese fries but they aren't the same as the location downtown Evanston.
"A trusty late night snack in downtown Evanston.  I've been coming here for a long time, always get the spicy, too chicken to get the suicide and usually a double order when two of us are eating it.  There's something about these wings that is comforting.  Of all the times I've eaten these wings I've probably only eaten in once.  The inside isn't the greatest decor so most times I choose carry out.  Come and give these wings a try."
"If your looking for some crunchy, juicy on the inside, great tasting wings, this is your spot. The food comes quickly and is made in front of you. There is usually a good size line of people ordering but moves fairly quick. I prefer mild flavor as it still packs a slight pinch and my husband likes suicide which includes chopped jalapeños. I have yet to try other items on the menu due to my diet, but their chips with cheddar look crazy amazing.  There is dining are in the back that I have yet to try out. This place is truly a hidden gem."
"Was not a fan of the cheddar chips. The consistency and flavor of the cheddar wasn't great, almost tasted like Merkts cheese. The fries were very soggy.Wings were okay. The crispiness and size of the wings were good. The hot sauce could have been tastier. Had to break out the Red Hot. Also wish that Bleu Cheese."
The quality of this place has gone down tremendously...  but the prices are rising.. $13.98 plus a half bag of fries.. less wings as well.. guess you have to be a NWU student in order to get quality.. I've been supporting this place over 30 years.. smh! If it was t for the taste I wouldn't return
"Kid who was working the register today, 11/7 was a total dud. When asked how spicy is the mild vs spicy, he said he didn't know. I'd imagine at a wing spot that question is pretty common. He looked annoyed, mild eye roll and was clear that he didn't care to be working, clearly didn't want to do his hair today either because he had a top knot tied on top of his head  that looked like a sloppy poodle and definitely not tying away the rest of his hair, which seemed unruly like Shaggy and could shed anywhere. We ordered to stay and were presented with our food to go, and in one order of wings, we had one drum and all flats that were basically skin and bones with little meat. The wings tasted good, but seeing photos here now it's clear that wasn't the standard. Everyone else that worked there was nice, but man was that kid rude. This is a job, put your best effort forward."
"How does this place have so many good reviews?!I ordered the suicide and bbq wings and buffalo chips on a Sunday evening. I called my order in and the employee at Buffalo Joe's was incredibly rude. She answered the phone with ""the waits 45 mins to an hour""Me ""that's ok. I'd still like to place an order please.""Her *silence*Me ""let me know when you're ready""Her ""I've been ready.""Me *says my order*Her ""you need to slow down."" Me *repeats order*Her ""ok bring cash in 45 mins.""And then my order was incorrect! She was also incredibly rude when I called back to check on the order. Me ""can I check if my food is ready?Her ""no, show up whenever you were told to show up. I'm busy""It ruined my appetite, I should've just taken my business elsewhere but the reviews say the food is great. It's not. Very mediocre. Covered in a disgusting sauce and they were cold. Maybe because there is no competition in the area, but a chain like Pluckers would put this place out of business. They need to invest more in their people and in customer service skills."
Their wings never disappoint - it's the special sauce!  My family always looks forward to sharing them.
This place is like legitimately good. The chicken is very juicy and always hitting the right spot. Personally I recommend their boneless chicken wings. In particular I recommend you guys get the buffalo style boneless wings. And when you add those with waffle fries....Oh my Jesus.... so good!!!Now the only reason why I'm going to give them four stars is because I'm still a little annoyed that they only take cash. To me not only is that a bit inconvenient but also a bit suspicious. But hey don't let that stop you from getting some of the best chicken in Evanston (and probably Chicago area)!! So head on the Buffalo Joe's if you're looking for some serious chicken!!
"I've been eating at Buff Joe's since 2013, and it has never let me down. The wings are fried to perfection and the sauce is just incredible. Not the fanciest place. You walk in, place order at counter, wait for them to call your order and you pay. Grab a table, and go crazy!I get the medium heat a delightfully vinegary hot sauce smother the PERFECTLY COOKED WINGS! All the wings are perfectly crispy and cooked thru to the bone!!! 100% recommend!"
"Great spot for quick takeout, especially during COVID as you can't even enter the restaurant! Food was okay , but it does the trick if you're in the mood for takeout - LOL! Would highly recommend the buffalo wings, so good!"
"After a late flight and hour drive to Evanston, we were looking for some good eats before turning in for the night! I love chicken wings so we decided to try Buffalo Joes. Initially, not what I was expecting at all. I was looking for a honey hot or sweet and spicy wing. When they said buffalo sauce only I am not going to lie here- I'm not a fan of buffalo sauce. My daughter ordered a small order the mild wings- which came with a dozen wings or so. I ordered some waffle fries as I debated on what I was gonna do for dinner....the staff and cooks were very friendly and inviting. This is also a cash only business - just an fyi. We got our food and left. When I seen the wings I was like well.... They weren't overly smothered or covered in buffalo sauce so I decided to try one. I will be the first to say, my apologies for being a wing snob as I am clearly not a wing expert ~ I almost missed out on some dam good wings... crispy outside which is my favorite and the flavor was absolutely not what I expected. It was very flavorful. We didn't get to snap a picture but was served with celery and a side of ranch."
The wing sauce n ranch so good I always get suicide with the peppers on top.. fye fye fye .. the cheese sauce is not the melted cheese but I still always get the Buffalo cheese fries
"In the midst of the many restaurant chains on the same block, Buffalo Joe's is a great find in downtown Evanston. It's popular with the college crowd since it's open until midnight and offers typical late night food such as wings and fries, but I also think it would be a great low-key place for a family outing as there's plenty of seating and they don't skimp on food. In my case, four of us ordered two double orders of wings and two orders of fries. We ended up with a to-go box full of wings. The only downside to this establishment is that it is cash only."
Favorite place for wings growing up and now. Always a must have when in Chicago. Dining is not offered with COVID but they're still open for take out. Call in your order and pay at the door. Someone will bring out your food. CASH ONLY. Love the suicide wings (with jalapeños) and waffle fries with cheese.
"These are the best wings on planet earth.Recommend going mild/spicy/suicide, but the bbq wings are also good. I always pair with a side of cheddar chips (waffle fries w/ merkt's cheddar) but if you're really looking for more calories you can get them spicy which comes covered in the buffalo sauce and jalapeños.Obviously bring cash. Cash only."
The food is great. Best wings . But the restaurant can be remodeled it's old and not clean very well.
"Hubby and I shared a double order of mild wings, buffalo chips, and a chili cheese dog. It ended up being a lot of food and in hindsight, we probably should have only gotten a single order of wings instead. The flavor of the wings was a little too sour/vinegary to me and the buffalo chips were just okay. I had higher expectations for the chili cheese dog since their chili is award winning but I much prefer the one at Boba Burger since it has more of a kick to it."
"Highly upset and disappointed. Wings are teeny tiny, hardly any meat on them, and we paid $70. Very upset $70 for what celery sticks and ranch?? Because there was no meat on those wings.   We would come here over 10 years ago and loved it. Today we drove over 35 miles and very disappointed. What a waste of time and money. Sauce is really good but get some meat on those bones!!"
"It's a wonder how I've been living in Evanston for 4+ years and never been to Buffalo Joe's until now. Its location is convenient in downtown Evanston and is very popular among college students with good reason.Three friends and I walked in for a late-night craving, and the four of us ordered two double orders of wings (BBQ and spicy) and two orders of fries. The portion is generous, and we ended up taking about half of the wings home. The wings themselves are very flavorful with ample amounts of sauce on them. The spicy wings were spicier than I expected, but I appreciated the kick. I'm so glad there were celery sticks on the side, as it would've been a very heavy meal without them. They are cash-only!"
"Employees are irresponsible, they lack professionalism.  All chatting and having a good old time while forgetting to pack things in my order. Cheese was missing for the nachos and an order of cheese fries. Unfortunately I didn't notice until I got home, 20 minute drive.  What is so hard about verifying the order before giving it to a customer?  Oh wait, that would mean the Employees have to be responsible which they are not.  I have gone there many times in the past and this time besides the lack of Employee responsibility the wings tasted as though they were not freshly fried.  Soggy and skimping on the sauce.  Wake up Mr. Buffalo Joe, Employees will ruin your business and put you out of business if action is not taken. From a customer being honest."
Buffalo joes definitely has the best wings I've ever tried. I've been coming to this location since I was a kid. And they definitely fail to disappoint. I always get the suicide wings because I enjoy spicy foods. Basically it's the hot with jalapeños on top. If you've never tried there wings I suggest you try it at-least once.
This was always my favorite spot to eat growing up. Now I drive out my way to get the wings after not working in the area anymore. The quality of the wings on my last two visits seemed to decrease a lot. They just tasted soggy and cheap. Also service there has always been iffy but i really didn't care because the food made up for it. Now without the food being top notch I don't know if I will continue coming back. Also tables are dirty most of the time. Time to remodel? Please get your restaurant back together I miss my wings! I may try you guys out one more time hopefully third times a charm.
"Unique sauce on the wings and consistently account for the four stars at this old stalwart. Their wings have shrank and prices have increased over the years. However, this is to be expected with chicken wing cost and demand up over years. A order of suicide wings ran $15.99 last visit.I also love the Buffalo Chips (waffle fries) with the merkts style cheese. Not even hungry, I stop by when passing through Evanston since the wings are that good. I always go with the suicide wings which aren't that spicy to be unenjoyable. I thought that the only thing that sets the suicide sauce different from hot was jalapeños. The order taker said it was a hotter sauce too but I really didn't notice much difference in the great level.The missing fifth star? The abrasive cashier and their pricing policy. Every other employee seems friendly though. I understand this is a college town. I'd just like to be talked to like I'm a human being. I requested a cup of tap water. $1 for a bottle was the response. She just kept repeating herself. 55 cents for another half full cup of ranch. I hate when I get nickel and dimed at places. CASH ONLY!"
Definitely great food please try the suicide wings! We order one or twice a month the place is always packed! This should tell you something the food is great!
Best wings in Chicago!   Spicy when you want it spicy and sweet when you want them sweet!  Need I say more...
terrible. service - 0 they are rude and unbotheredfood - 1 taste is not goodprice- 1 over priced and small portionsarchitectural design- 0 the workers constantly are walking back in front in front of the customers because they have no door behind the counterworst experience evernightmare
Excellent mild sauce but the wing quality and the customer service is the reason for the low rating.
"I used to go here regularly about 20 years ago. Decided to take my boyfriend since we were in the area and boy am I glad I did. I was worried it might not be as good as I remember, but they were just as good and reminded me just how much I Love Buffalo Joe's! I am not there for the ""service"" like some people commented on. With food as good as theirs I really don't pay attention to the people who work there - and for the record, they were just fine for me, so no complaints there! Their wings are so damn good - suicide!!! Mmmmmm!!! And the Buffalo Chips (waffle fries) with the cheese are a perfect side to go with the wings! And who doesn't enjoy RC??? They even had a giant oatmeal chocolate chip cookie - which are my favorite, for only $0.79 each, can't beat that! Love this place... can't wait to go back again! Hopefully it won't be another 20 years!"
"Best damn wings in Chicago, got my mom hooked on them who doesn't even like wings- Lambros"
"Food is delicious! We got a double order of the wings and a Chicago style hot dog. Only thing that made it difficult was that this place is cash only, but there is an ATM around the corner. Looks like during non-covid times you can also use the ATM they have in stores."
"Pro-tip: some of the best wings in the Chicagoland area! Come here! Cash only! ATM on site!Ordered a personal 60 piece private tray for me my brother and my friends.Thankfully, I preordered days in advance and they were extremely professional and organized amidst hungry customers clamoring for their orders.The key to their wings lies in their homemade sauce. Unlike most places, Buffalo Joe's makes their sauce from scratch. They don't simply douse it with franks red sauce or canned buffalo sauce commonly find at any grocery store. No sir, they make it, and it's truly special. Consider buying a pint for yourself just so that you can have some salsa for your chips.At a dollar a wing, it's pricy, but worth it. My only complaint is celery, ranch and extra sauce are sold separately!"
"Fantastic wings. The sauce is great. Good fries too. Worth a visit, especially for carry out during football season."
"Maybe I'm bias towards this place because it's the key to my childhood. I grew up on these wings. And literally walking through the doors of this joint is like a time capsule--the same as when I was young. I still believe that these are the best buffalo wings in town...I don't care what you say. The sauce, I'm pretty sure (like 99.9 % sure) that the secret ingredient in that Buff Joe's sauce is crack, it's the only explanation why those wings are so addicting.Yes, the wings are a bit smaller than before. But, it's fried perfectly and they don't really count how many wings they put in the plate like other places, they just fill it up, so it doesn't really matter how big those wings are...you still get the same amount in weight, so not sure why people complain about how small it is. Anyway, back to the wings...nothing compares to it. I've tried many different ones, this place still makes it the best.Oh and bring cash, they don't take cards...which is a bit annoying to some. But, I like the charm of it...go ahead and evade tax Buff Joe's, I still support you (I'm almost halfway convince they don't, haha)!!!"
Food was extremely cold went in there and spent almost 60 dollars I would not eat from there again. The only thing that was hot were the fries..I would not waste my money again in there. I was disappointed.
"I was hanging out w/a friend who only eats chicken & fish meats so I was scrolling my book marks, saw the suicide wings showed her the pic and bam we drove an hour to get there. As far as wing variety for flavors it's not many options. Bbq, spicy, or suicide & I'm sure plain. Where's the lemon pepper? Spicy garlic? Parm? Ok they're not here obviously, LOL. Ordered the single order of suicide wings. They are a decent size. Yet they're not that hot. I was actually expecting not to be able to eat them all due to the spice. Nope. I ate them ALL. A little disappointed there too. My wings also weren't piping hot. They were warm. I do appreciate that they aren't stingy with the sauce it's swimming in it! They come with ranch & celery which was nice. They give complimentary tap water too. Friend had suicide wings, & an order of spicy & bbq mixed & cheese fries. The cheese was cold on her fries she picked that off. Her wings were fire hot, but not spice hot 2 her either. The employees were very nice and accomodating. I'd go back, just not in a hurry."
Never a bad experience at Buffalo Joes. I always get the barbecue spicy mixed. Try their sandwiches as well.
"One of my favorite wing spots. Unique crispy chicken wings . My favorite is the mild . And waffle fries :). With extra ranch. I'm not a drum person but with buff joes , I eat everything ! Only down thing is that they only accept cash ."
"This place was a decent place for wings in the past. However, most recently, it has been disappointing. That might be an understatement. We got a tray of wings for a party, and these were some of the smallest wings I have ever seen. They were so laughably small that I hesitate to call them chicken wings. For this reason, I regretfully decrease my rating from a 4 to a 3. This is still the only wings place in Evanston, so they have that."
"Buffalo Joe's is a great wings place. Their wings are delicious and if you a spicy-lover, this is the place to go. Their waffle fries are extremely tasty, though the cheese on the fries hardens and tastes kind of bad after a while. I would definitely go here over Buffalo Wild Wing's with a group of friends, because the atmosphere is nicer and the wings are just as good."
"During a visit to nearby Northwestern U, the admissions counselor joked about never going hungry as an undergrad because he lived above Buffalo Joe's. That was as good a recommendation as I've heard before.  Never passing up an opportunity for college town eats, we headed over there for lunch after our campus tour. Street parking is readily available on this side street.  You walk in, order at the register and wait to be called to pick up your food.The grilled chicken sandwich was moist & tasty.  The chicken tenders were a little over cooked, but still good, as were the waffle fries.  The namesake wings were disappointing though.  Even though the texture and taste were good, the wingettes are so small, they looked like they came from downtown pigeons.  A decent amount of about 13-14 per order, but the meat on them were pretty scrawny.  You might have to get a double order if you're hungry.  Reminds me of my college buddy who could stick a wing in his mouth, swish it around and spit out a clean bone.  That talent ranks up there with tying a cherry stem into a knot.  Wings are good for silly bar tricks to impress your buddies, but not enough for a meal."

"Comfort food when you're craving fried and unhealthy artery clogging substances.  The location on Howard Street in Chicago needs a bath, a major remodeling.    The location in Evanston is better."
"If you're craving hot, spicy, mouth watering wings- this is the spot for you. This place is a total dive and awesome spot for an afternoon snack after a football game or quick weeknight dinner. The wings cannot be beat- we dream about them and wish they'd deliver to Lakeview (farther down south in Chicago). Waffle fries are pretty good as well- but ask for them well done!Only downside is the decor and atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired- tables can sometimes be left messy and the bathrooms are sub par - basically your typical bar style environment. Best thing to do is call ahead an order take out!"
"One of the best places around Evanston to eat some wings. Orders are made on the spot. The classic wing sauce is above average with great flavor.  The handmade ranch sauce has great taste. The place is full of sports memorabilia that could make you feel like your taken to their very own man cave. Although they give you a lot of celery it all goes well pretty good with a beer. Just be ready to pay cash, as no cards are accepted. They do however have an ATM machine inside for the convenience. Overall a good go to spot for wings."
"Immediately walking into the store, my friends and I lowkey regret entering this place and started feeling a bit intimidated. It was our first time in Evanston and we were unfamiliar with the neighborhood.I timidly placed our double order of chicken wings and was curious if I could pick two sauce for the wings. The waiter replied to my question by a roll of her eyes and I was a bit lost..so I asked to clarify ""yes I can pick two sauces or no I can't?"" and she roughly answered no. So I settled for the BBQ flavored wings with an order of waffle fries. It came out to less than $20 and enough to feed 3 people. CASH ONLY.The food came out fairly fast and we quickly dug in. After the first bite, all my regrets of coming into this store went away and I was in chicken wing heaven. The wings were perfectly crispy and a right portion of meat on each wing. The double order came with carrots and celery. And the waffle fries were yummy, too!Cheap metered parking across the street and around the neighborhood. Walking distance to Northwestern campus."
Buffalo Joe's in Evanston has great spicy wings with light tangy taste. You can buy a single order or double order depending on your hunger pangs. The only downside is being a cash only restaurant which forces you to buy bottled water. Their wings are expensive. I still prefer Buffalo Wild Wings for their spicy garlic sauce and buy one get one free wings on Tuesdays special.
This place ALWAYS hit the spot. Highly recommend if you like Beer and Wings with a company of good friends. Very friendly staff and always attentive to their customers!
"Terrible, awful, inedible, chicken wings without actual chicken meat. Some people have nostalgia vision with this place but even BWW has better wings than this trash hole."
"I don't expect much I grew up on Buff Joes as a kid and it's drastically changed in quality from what I remember. However, I should at least expect my $12 single order bite sized wings to be cooked thoroughly. A few of my wings tasted like it went from the fridge to the sauce. Need to better on their quality control this is not cool."
"Buffalo Joe's you're one of a kind!  I've been enjoying your food since the mid-80's when I was an undergrad at NU.  Every time I make it back as an alum, my friends and I make a point to eat your place.  The amazing taste of your wings, sauce, and cheddar fries has forever been imprinted in the taste centers of my brain.  So has the RC Cola.  Who  offers RC Cola?  Who only takes cash?  You Buffalo Joe's! You're one of a kind!"
Great wings. Good family spot.We cater for games.
"Solid 4 stars. Food is really good, and doesn't take crazy long to make. Unfortunately, only cash is accepted, and the location isn't exactly crystal clean. Would recommend calling in advance for carry out."
Best wings in town. So blessed to be located just minutes away from this location. This review is only based off their mild wings. They're crispy and flavorful. Goto this place if you're in the area. You won't regret it.
"This is supposed to be the go to spot, nah NEXT. I just paid $16 for 10 small Wings I could eat in 2 bites and cheese fries that had cheese that tasted like it was heated straight from a cheese wiz can. Didn't even eat the fries so I wouldn't get sick. I can't recommend this place"
"Ahhh. Buffalo Joe's. I hope you stick around forever and ever. The very first time I ever visited Chicago-land area was to visit my BFF who happened to live in Evanston at the time (she attend Northwestern grad school). She took me here for their wings, and I got to try it a few times again after I moved to Chicago. This is one of those places that just need to stay the same as a true Chicago staple.While I do love spicy food, it's been a little more difficult for my stomach to handle as I got older. Plus, I like to taste my food, and I get sad when something is so numbingly spicy that I can't taste anything anymore. Anyway, I just like to get the spicy wings and a side of fries. I'm not a huge fan of the cheddar cheese because it's a little too heavy for me for some reason. While I do love my cheese fries, I just haven't quite developed a taste for this kind yet. Maybe I'll get around to it :)"
"How do you even write a review for the greatest wing joint on gods green earth? If there ain't jalepenos on your wings and a large RC cola next to your tray, you did it wrong. I've been going here since I was a kid. My only complaint is that buff joes has very effectively ruined wings for me as nobody can ever compare."
Pretty good wings. The service is really good and quick. Every one is willing to help and take your order. The wings were packed with flavor. The wings are pretty small and don't really fill you up. It's more of a local wing spot for college kids. Great wings with awesome flavor though.
"The food deserves 5 stars. Their wings are the absolute best. I drove about an hour out of the way to get them. That being said I will not be returning until post pandemic. Walked up to find a full staff of unmasked employees inside the restaurant, including the people preparing the food and the person bringing it out. I asked if I needed to call in the order and was met with a rude response. I work in a restaurant and get that wearing a mask a whole shift sucks, but I'm not trying to put myself at risk for wings, as delicious as they are. I will try again later when things are safer."
I drive all the way from Humboldt park to eat these delicious wings. I am giving a 1 star rating because the women who answered was VERY rude and hung up as I was deciding what flavor I wanted. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY EXPERIENCE ORDERING.
"I can't complain about the food-everything tastes great. The wings are super crispy and all of the sauces hit the spot. Their cheddar chips are really rich and tasty. My only complaint is the service. I get it, you don't like your job, but you can at least say thanks when getting a tip and not just walk away and say nothing. Some people don't even tip for carry out so be respectful when your neighbors are supporting your business. If a competitor opened up nearby I think this place would lose customers because of how bad the service is. I only go back because the food is that good."
"i want my wedding, birth of first born, and funeral to all happen at buffalo joe's clark street. i love this place more than life itself5 starssssssssssss"
I love this place they have the best wings suicide sauce is the best make sure to get the waffle fries and the ranch. I also like the turkey club sandwich and the rc cola
"The guy with the short oily hair denied me all flats or heavy flats whatever they call it...expressing that it's Friday and we can't do it on the Holiday. Up charge me for the inconvenience. Food is over rated. Fries are ok sort of like Chick fil a but not the cheese dip. Grainy thick cheese. Wings are ok, kind of sweet on the back end. Second time visiting here and got the suicide for the second time as well...I would not be back as I continue this lonely journey looking for the ""perfect"" wing here in Chicago"
"Did not finish my mild wings because they were cold, dry and lacking sauce. I've heard so much about how good this place is and was very disappointed in this order. I do not recommend eating wings here."
"The last time a visited Evanston I regretted I didn't get to eat wings from Buffalo Joe's.  I heard great views from the Uber driver and my daughter heard the wings  highly recommended. I am here over the Memorial Day weekend 2021 and a finally got a chance to try the wings. Sadly, I was highly disappointed.  These were the worst, tasteless wings ever.  I ordered the mild, single order and the wings were cold and the sauce had no taste.  I actually threw most of the wings away.  Don't waste your money like I did."
"Two Chicago dogs, chili fries and 2 beers for $19. Cash only but holy shit is it worth it. The guy was so nice, piped up samples of chili before we were even considering it.I see why this is the best in the area!!!Will be back!"
"Gosh I missed buff joes. Heck, I missed Evanston. I haven't been to this part of town in ages (actually since my best friend moved from here to Portland in 2002) and boy did it feel good to be back. If you find yourself this far north and in the mood for some good old fashion fast food, come check buffalo joes out.The young chicks at the counter loved their job and gave my buddy and I samples of their chili and cream of rice soup. Both were actually delicious. But we came for the wings, which is what buff joes is most famous for.We ordered 10 bbq wings, 10 spicy and 10 suicide wings (which is spicy with jalapeños on top) and a side of cheese fries. The food was served piping hot and the tasted as if they were fried fresh to order.Attn readers - this is classic fast food, which I am a sucker for. Don't go walking in here thinking you're gonna get some gastropub type wings topped with organic herbs and chives for decoration. But nonetheless mega delicious."
"Great wings, terrible service. Seriously, the wings alone would get 5 stars. But the service is seriously lacking. They have no patience for you to read the menu, and get upset by questions. They will not give you a cup for water. Absolutely not, under no circumstances. I even offered to pay for the cup. Wings are saucy, salty, and spicy, hydration is important. They will only sell bottled water or fountain soda. They are cash only. Welcome to 2018, I think it's time Joe. With mobile payments becoming prevalent, you've almost skipped cards completely. The whole place feels dirty. Tables are sticky, floor is full of crumbs. I hope they keep the kitchen area cleaner. Oh, and they eat in the kitchen while prepping the food, that's gross. Sorry Joe, your wings are great, but I can't overlook the issues any longer."
The best wings and chedda chips around! Buff Joes does things the right way. One of the many things I miss about the North Shore food scene.
"food was bomb as hell. i really wish they took card though, i had to take out more cash than i had to spend and i don't like carrying cash. it wasn't a big deal though. either way i'd recommend getting the suicide wings"
"Buff Joe's.... always works their magic.When someone mentions it, the response is usually: ""omg Buff Joe's, it's SO good let's go there NOW!"" said quickly, almost panicky in one breath.  Or followed by: ""I need Buff Joe's, why'd you have to mention it, we need to go NOW!""When someone mentions your favorite type of food, you have a mini anxiety attack when your mouth waters and you need dem wings... That's kinda what happens... no matter what time of day.I always get a single order of Suicide Wings (topped with jalapenos) with a side of waffle fries (""Buffalo Chips"" $1.89).   Your order will come with celery and ranch, and a wetwipe (which you will certainly need).  Sometimes I'll wash everything down with an RC.Their wings are freshly fried, then tossed in tangy sauce.  A single order is $7.99 and you better bring cash because it's CASH only... but they have a generic ATM right inside the restaurant in case you forget.They also serve beer and these little oatmeal chocolate chip cookies in a huge tub by the cashier, which look heavenly, but I never have room for dessert.  Also, they have a ""XXX"" sauce which is a spicy habenero-type darker red sauce... which I have only requested on the side as a sample because I heard eating an order with that sauce is brutal for your tastebuds.  Try it on the side first to see if you'll like it because once you start it's so spicy it hurts.So maybe I have an unhealthy relationship with this place.  But if wings were ever going inside my stomach, they better be from here.  When friends visit from out of town, I'll take them to Buff Joe's and with a serious face, say: ""These are the best wings in Chicago.""  (Deep dish pizza will be tomorrow night...)I only go to the Clark location, although there are two others on Green Bay and Howard.  After I have gone and out-done myself again in the form of massive wing consumption, I say I've reached my Buff Joe's quota, forever.  But of course I end up coming back the following month or so.This stuff is on par with being one of my last meals on urf.  Heaven on urf...earth."
"Man, oh, man! This place right here....is golden. I'm not sure if this restaurant is all over Chicago but let me tell you something..it needs to be. I saw a coworker eating wings one day for lunch and I was just like  those look awfully good! For a second, I thought it was from Harold's (because I'm not from here) and he's all like no, ""buffalo joes"" So you know me, (well you don't know me) but I had to give this place a try! I went with my roommate and I ordered the suicide wings with a side of fries. I was a little blown because they only accepted cash so I trekked to find an ATM then later realized there was one inside of the restaurant. It came up to like $12. I was like this food better be damned good! the wait wasn't long at all but let me tell you, it was WELL worth it. My wings were like hot wings with jalepenos on them...omg my mouth is watering just thinking about it. It was SO!!!!! Good. Like, I have found my new place for whenever I'm craving wings. And the fries...SOOOOOOO good. They're like waffle fries but whatever seasoning that they use...it's amazing. Let me tell you.  I will definitely be back for more"
I LOVE Buffalo Joes. It's not close to where we live but it's so worth it that we do it. I always get the mild wings and never disappointed. The only thing I don't like and this is purely personal is their cheese. I would love it if their cheese was the same type as portillos. Service has never been a problem.
"What happen to this place?  I had been coming here since my high school days, that's back in the 90's, yes I am dating myself.  Back then the wings were of higher quality and the staff was fun and friendly.  I usually go out of my way to come by Buffalo Joe's when in town.  I believe it is no longer worth it.  The nostalgia is all but gone.  When I arrived there were no happy can I get your order or help of any kind.  Two employees chatting away ignoring us and only turning around to give us the look of ""oh no, more customers.""  The young individual that helped me did not say a word only stood there ready with his pen and order receipt.  When I ordered my wings only silence and dissatisfaction set in.  As we walked down the line, the soda lady was worse, moody for no reason. Next, the cashier, ignoring me as I hand her my order receipt.  The taste of my wings that are now 2-3 times smaller is no longer captivating. Some of the flavor still maintains but I would no longer drive out of my way for this place.  I guess it's finally time to move on."
"The angry dread locks guy behind the counter is at it again. Heard him cussing out customers when they walked away with their order.  The worst part was him sneezing into the food prep area without even trying to cover his mouth and then went straight back to serving food without washing his hands. Never thought eating chicken wings would mean risking your life, but here we are."
"The place smells like rotting meat and the tables are filthy.  The worst part is the service, especially the angry guy with dreadlocks behind the counter.  I feel bad this is all he's got, but don't take it out on the customers."
The food is absolutely amazing my favorite wings by far & im from Wisconsin but if you order for pickup through phone expect an attitude while ordering
"A classic, an original, a legend in its own time. When wing aficionados, Northwestern Alums, or connoisseurs of cheap eats fly into Chicago, it's not the Mag mile or reflective bean they wanna see -- it's 'Take me straight to Buffalo Joe's!'A tradition and an obsession, BJ's has a no bs style all it's own. You can't say no to their chicken wing sauces, and you'll always want more ranch dressing."
"I'm glad to hear people refer to these wings as quite possibly the best wings around Chi. Have tried quite a few spots on the Northside and limited spots on the South and Westside. These were easily the best ""hot"" wings around the greater Chicago area imo.Get the suicide and cheese waffle fries. That should be sufficient. This spot or chicken shack are good sunday spots. Yeah, Nevin's pub has NFL ticket but I'd always wait to finish games and grab food from here or south of Howard. The sauce for the wings has the perfect balance between butter and hot sauce. The wings are crispy but not overcooked.One thing I haven't found on the east coast, west coast, or in the south is a good hot wing sauce that doesn't enhance the sogginess multiplier of the wings. These suicide wings stay as crispy as a dry rub lemon pepper/cajun seasoning. Baffles my mind.There is a location on either side of the train tracks and most students stay on this side."
I will travel far for these wings........ seriously my favorite wing sauce....waffle fries are perfect with the ranch dressing.... it's something about their sauce and dressing.... I've been coming here for more than 20years..... I even rode my bicycle from the south side to this location just for wings... and it's the greatest reward...
The best wings around hands down.  I've been going here for over 30 years when I have a hankering for wings.  Love their ranch and Buffalo chips too
"Ok here's the news;Got a lil hungry didn't want mah leftovers ha ha WHo doesn't !! So I was like imma catch that sweet purple line express up to Evanstonia to get some Bj's and BOY did I get some bj's ha ha lemme tell u Wut yum yum !!I got the wings. So I got the wings and they were great rly slobbering U know yum! Wow just.   Ok so I got the wings are em up slurslurp yum! Sometimes when I come here I realize that, u know, maybe lif e isn't worth liveing but u know Wut maybe it is b/c of how good bj's is. Rly down w/ this place, down w/ the stuff they serve u RIGHT lemme tell u.5/5"
"Who is this kid that they have answering the phones and working the register???? This was on the evening of 12/3. He first answered the phone as if he was either high or had just woken up, was not clear on the prices as we ordered for takeout and upon picking up said takeout he was just... ugh... Completely lackluster service. I really used to love coming here but both the quality of service and food has gone DOWN. The wings were not good at all and just covered in sauce. The hot dog that I ordered for my toddler was charred.... TO DEATH... it even had black soot on the bun.... just... good grief we threw 75% of our order in the garbage.."
"Who eats buffalo wings for breakfast? We do. Mostly because we woke up at lunch time, but that is neither here nor there.LOCATION/ATMOSPHEREThe location in downtown Evanston is perfect for students and residents alike. The vibe is quite ""divey"" and it is obvious that Buffalo Joe's is a local spot. Because of this, the inside is not the cleanest I've seen but it didn't bother me much.FOODThe wings themselves were a little bit smaller and drier than I was hoping for. We got the spiciest option with jalapeno on the side...The jalapeno was just the canned kind, which made it seem even cheaper. Celery was included on the side. Crisp and fresh, nothing out of the ordinary.I also got a baked potato on the side, which was basic and microwaved and a little expensive for being microwaved.SERVICE/VALUEThe only reason we went to Buffalo Joe's was because a friend insisted we tried it because it was ""AMAZING"". As a result, our expectations were high and we were sorely disappointed by the average quality of the food. At least it was not expensive so we didn't feel like we wasted our money.The employees were casual and friendly, if not a little brusque. However, they did let us try some gumbo, which was DELICIOUS. Next time I'll just get the gumbo and skip the chicken wings."
My favorite place in Chicago for spicy chicken wings. I always get a single order of spicy wings with their fries and a RC! Highly recommend!!!
"We ordered a double order of wings that's $22 and were given a different meal than what we ordered which is $10+. Didn't realize we were given the wrong order til we got home. I've called them repeatedly and they are not picking up the phone. I will reach out to them again tomorrow to see if they'll rectify their mistake and repost my review. If not, this review remains a one star."
"I've been here many times before, but on my last trip to Northwestern this weekend to do an interview, the only thing on my mind was getting these wings.  They have that much control over me.Ok, sure they're tiny, but they're damn tasty.  And since a single order gets you around  a dozen of these bad boys, you should be good with just that - even though I usually get double orders anyway.  What puts this location over the other ones are their cheddar chips - waffle fries with Cheese Whiz-ish sauce dumped on top.  So delicious, provided you finish them off before the cheese morphs back into its semi-solid state.Never had anything else from here - I'm good with my suicide wings, thanks."
"Been going to Buffalo Joes for 30 yrs or so. Usually it is a quick in and out, great food, cash only. My last experience was stupid, if a restaurant experience can rank as stupid?  Ok, it was very crowded, hot, and stuffy!!  My family of 5 and I jump up to place our order. I told the ""rude"" girl taking my order that I would like to order 6 mild wings, fries with cheese and a Diet Coke. She says ""6 oh mid"". I couldn't understand what in the hell she was trying to communicate?? I told her I don't know what you are saying?  She kept repeating ""6 oh mid.""  She said this like 4 times and I still had no idea what she was trying to say??  When my husband got up he ordered for the kids and himself. The girl said "" she just ordered a bunch of wings, are you sure you want to order more?""  He asks what I ordered. She says I ordered 60 wings!  WTF, who orders 60 wings for themselves?  I am lucky if I can eat 4 of the 6 I tried to order.  This is beyond stupid!!!  Secondly, if I order a Diet Coke, they will serve you ""RC.""  There is a shitload of sugar in RC and I don't drink the ""sugar loaded"" drinks. So this ""rude"" girl takes her order pad and rips off the sheet and proceeds to throw it down and says ""ok, it doesn't work like that.""  She proceeds to get annoyed and coughs down into the Merkt cheese. Freakin gross!!!  So I tell her that I would like one order of 10 mild wings, because ordering 6 isn't what they do. Ok, so we cleared up that communication problem. After we got our food, we are sitting and eating. One of the workers is dragging a drippy garbage bag throughout the seating area. There is a huge smear of garbage on the floor. This place seemed so freaking dirty and now garbage is being smeared on the floor next to where ppl are eating their food. Outside of the rude girl who had no ppl or communication skills, the RC sugar-loaded drink and the feeling of dirty restaurant, I don't think I will continue to go the place. The first 30 years were tolerable, but rudeness and  dirty environment are not what I pay for when trying to get some grub.  What a disappointing experience!!  I couldn't wait to get out of there to wash my hands. My husband was totally appalled by this ""stupid"" dirty experience, too."
"Wings = 4 starsCustomer Service = 2 starsCleanliness = 0 starsThe spicy wings are cooked perfectly and are actually quite tasty.However, I really wish they would clean up this joint!The unsanitary conditions in addition to the unappetizing smell in the dining area is such a negative! Still cash only, but there is an ATM next to the cash register."
"How do I not have a review for Buffalo Joe's as I go here regularly??? I thought I wrote a review here years ago but I guess not. Anyways, straight up, no BS, Buffalo Joe's is the best wings I ever had in my life and it doesn't really come close. I got stuck in Buffalo once for a work trip and had Buffalo wings at Anchor Bar which is nationally famous for. I remember taking a bite, all I could think of is how much I missed Buffalo Joe's when I lived in NYC. It's the best wings I ever had and it doesn't even come close. The sauce is unique, it's not your typical boring buffalo sauce but this place has a twist. You can get different kinds of sauces, I always get the suicide, tops off with jalapeno peppers and extra buffalo sauce. Also, I always get the cheddar chips. They use Merkt's Cheddar here. Listen, any restaurant that serves their food with Merkt's cheddar has my trust and loyalty. Everything is great here. The only real downfall is that it's cash only. Normally I would dock it a star because of the inconvenience but I can't complain. Best wings in the world. Been going here for over 15 years now. I should get hook ups...for being such a damn loyal customer but I was not blessed with great looks and height that make me stand out in the crowd. Le Sigh. CASH ONLY! DON'T FORGET!"
"Very disappointed in last visit.  I've been coming here since I was an undergrad for over 30yrs, and brought my son to experience a truly authentic, non-chain, wing/burger joint.  Unfortunately, his order sat on the counter for at least 10min while my order was prepared.  In line cooking, you usually work the easier orders last, so everything arrives around the same time.  In the meantime, a steady stream of carryout pickups came in.  Once my order was ready, it was another 10+min in line to pay, since cashier was also filling up gut-buster sized soft drinks.  Not the most efficient workflow -- it felt excruciatingly long.  So, after a half-hour wait from ordering to table, for a couple of tepid burgers, cold fries, and a wallet being $20+ lighter (w/o drinks!), I will choose elsewhere next time (like a better/hotter/faster/cheaper Portillo's or Superdawg), and leave this for the college kids trying to improve upon their weekend dorm dining.  A thorough scrub-down of the seating area wouldn't be bad, either.Rave's:  If you only want wings, don't mind standing around, jockeying for a table to sit at, and have a lot of time to kill (pre-tailgate or post-game), this is still the place to go; friendly and polite staffRant's:  Not the most family friendly, long waits, limited seating, overall value"
"Best. Wings. Ever. Perfect drunk food. The wings are crispy and the sauce is good. It's just good. The celery isn't bad either. If you come here and complain about the customer service or decor, you're not getting the point of this place. It's just good food for good times with the boiz."
"Icky icky poo poo! This place is filthy! ""Man them sum damn good wings doh."" Said Homeslice after commenting how filthy this pigsty is. Honestly, instead of your employees yelling and screaming at each other and talking about nonsense could they take a few moments to wipe off the tables, wipe off the salt and pepper shakers, wipe up the floor ,empty the trash cans, or do something??!!! It reminds me of another question:Are all those sighing people behind your counter paid to be there or are they just there because they have nothing else to do or because they're doing the customers a favor? Because they sure don't act like they are actually there to ""WORK"".And now this part is for the owners and management only:Is it possible that you could hire fewer folks if you hired more competent people? Is it possible by not having a restaurant that everybody talks about as being so filthy you might get more business? Have you considered cleaning your restaurant in the last decade? Are you paying off the health inspectors? (There's no way this place passes code!) Really, the bottom of my garbage cans are cleaner."
"Ghetto and rude! Once you walk in your greeted with rudeness. I'll stick to Buffalo Wild Wings and wing stop. The black people working here are extremely rude are not friendly.  I over heard them talking about a gay male white customer who ordered his food just before I did. Once the customer left they started, mocking his mannerisms and joking about his alternative life style. I don't appreciate prejudice people. I canceled my order and walked out!!"

"The wings are good, the chocolate chip cookies are amazing, but I've been in cleaner bathrooms at the train station. The entire restaurant was filthy. The booths, tables and floors were sticky and covered in grease. I am shocked they have not been closed down.I give you an A for food, and a D++ For being DIRTY!!!!!"
"Brooo these place smacks!! I've been goin there fo like 4 years now. Hands down this my favorite place grab a bite. Wish the place was open till 12am. People there nice asl too, these works work hard to make sho is op everytime. No cap"
"I love Buffalo Joe's!! It is hands down one of my favorite wing places. I usually get the suicide wings and suicide fries, which is basically hot wings and hot fries, topped with jalapenos!! This can be a little spicy so I recommend you get a large drink with your food. It is great for sit down eating or carrying out. Keep in mind that they are cash only. That is the only downside since most people these days use credit cards for the most part. However, as long as you have $10-$15 cash with you, you'll be fine! Lots of metered street parking as well around this area. It is located in downtown Evanston."
Best wings I've ever had!  The wings have gotten a little smaller throughout the years...but the flavors are still amazing.  I recommend mixing their buffalo sauce with their BBQ sauce (they'll mix for you if you ask).And....Waffle FRIES
"Complete hole-in-the-wall AWESOMENESS!! No frills, just great wings. Get a single order of mild and if really hungry waffle fries & cheese on the side. Wings really can't be beat anywhere locally in my opinion. This place is CASH ONLY!"
"Ugggh, pains me to give them this rating but they are most shady during the pandemic. Yesterday I ordered a double order of spicy wings. When i got home and opens the container, i was in total disbelief! The wings are now the size of my pinky finger in length and the width of my thumb. Literally these are appetizer size. They may have equaled the weight of a single order... and that is a strong MAYBE! This is the worst part, i was charged for a double order. I paid $20 bucks for a $7 appetizer at TGIF. What bothers me the most is the intentional scamming of long time customers. They obviously don't value us. I get it... NU's student population is low and they aren't getting the usual business but to cheat everyone like this is unacceptable. So please to the warning... you will get less that 1/2 the meat you previously paid 20 bucks for. If you are taking it home to your hungry teens... don't do it... you will be more than upset that you just purchased them a snack and now have to purchase a REAL dinner.Shame on you Buffalo Joe's! I know times are hard but you stooped to an unforgivable low."
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Literally. This place has not changed since I began coming here since 1990. Only difference is quality of chicken and river boat of sauce that used to accompany it. Things change but this place has not. Over time I become accustom to certain taste and foods and outgrow it, not this place. The sauce (Spicy) is what brings me back every time. I've now passed this place along to two other generations and they love it just the same. I know what it is about this restaurant, but it keeps us comin back. #addictive"
"Food was good. BBQ and spicy. BBQ didn't really taste like BBQ. Spicy was spicy but really salty.Charred burger was a good classic burger.Celery sticks were old.Wipes provided.Cash only.No refill on drinks.Everything was all good until HAIR. HAIR. HAIR.I knew it wasn't either mine or my boyfriends hair. I closely examined it and it wasn't.The girl who took the order already put us in a bad mood because she was rude so it wasn't even worth telling them. We just wanted to get out of there.We encountered some of the other staff and they were rude as well. It's a small space. Both the cooking area and the customer area, I get it. But the words ""excuse me"" doesn't hurt anyone. That is all."
Major disappointment! Maybe they are buying cheap wing again because the last two visits have been bad news.  How are you gonna charge $1 per wing and the bones break while you are eating.  I wanted wings not bone marrow and nasty looking at that.  I'm not sure what happened here but hopefully it will get better when school is back in session.  Wtf?!?
EL CAPITAN! This guy is like the captain but crossed with EL MACHO!  Been coming here for over 20 years and glad to see some things never change.  Sauce is one of a kind and honestly I have never tasted anything like it anywhere else in the world.  Only complaint is the price.  You can't charge $10 bucks for 10 wings.  Come on fellas.

"This place has the best wings ever!! I don't know what the captain puts in this sauce but it is AMAZING.  I call him the Captain because he has been there for over 20 years running the ship.  If you see him you will know.  Now the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I have been bamboozled with a bad batch of wings but never when the Captain is there.   One time my order got lost and the captain immediately gave me a new order free of charge.   Granted I waited over 45 minutes but hey he's the captain and he acknowledged his mistake. In his defense, he was really busy.  Double order mild(""spicey"" is extra sauce and hot is with jalapeños) with cheddar chips and a large ice water. Sometimes water is yellow.  Watch for that.....I can still smell the sauce in my fingertips.  Yum."
"Upon coming in I could tell what kind of ride I was in for. I'm visiting from out of town and had just left the movies and wanted some food for the hotel. The line halfway out the door showed me that this would be a local gem or just hype. Sigh, no disrespect but it was hype to me. Now the aroma of the wings definitely keeps you in, and they did look juicy sitting on the counter. Now the first thing that threw me off was when I asked for a double basket, if they can split it for two sauces. The gentleman told me no. I pondered on why if the ""double"" order came in two SEPARATE boats and not one big boat, why couldn't I get two sauces. But whatever to make that extra $4. Now the ""wing"" are basically wing dings, cut from something younger than a fryer. Almost looked like Cornish hen wings. Now I ordered a double basket and two buffalo chips, one with cheese. Now I wish someone would have mentioned the waffle fries were seasoned with a salty ranch like powder, because that mixed with the plastic cheese sauce was just terrible. 3 bites and I threw it away. Now the wings were cooked nicely, but I couldn't get down with the sauce. I got buffalo and my girl got bbq. When I think of buffalo, I think of spicy yet buttery. Like a 80:20 ratio of spice to butter. These buffalo wings were not spicy one bit. Almost tasted sweet. Didn't finish them. Also when I think of buffalo wings I think of blu cheese as the condiment. Only ranch was provided and it wasn't hittin. My girl said the bbq was good and fries were good by themselves, I will admit that. Just don't get the buffalo expecting it to me spicy, and just get the fries plain jane. The check out process is confusing as well, I seen orders sit on the counter for 5-7 min waiting to be claimed by the purchaser, but also within the sneeze/cough zone of everyone else lined up to pay for their order."
"Came to Buffalo Joes excited to try another wing place but left very disappointed. Service was fine, food was okay, but it's not worth the price. I got the single order and its 10-12 small wings the size of your pinky for $10.50 with tax. I don't eat much but I left hungry. Could have gotten a more filling lunch from a plethora of options in the area."
"Buffalo Wild Wings and Wing Stop aren't on squad in comparison to Buffalo Joe's!! This is the spot!! Located in Evanston, there's two locations, one in downtown Evanston and one on the border of Evanston and Chicago, right on Clark and Howard. Although it looks a big outdated, this place is known for its wings. They only take cash and I would highly recommend ordering before you go in because the place is almost always packed. I cannot tell you how many times I've had late night cravings for their wings and I drove all the way from West Ridge to Evanston to get my fix, they are that worth it! They have four flavors, barbecue, mild, spicy and suicide. Although the mild as good, my favorite is the barbecue. They have two sizes you can choose from, a single order comes with ten wings and a double order comes with twenty wings. If you get a single order, you can't order half barbecue and half mild.... you can just order one order of whatever flavor you wish. I love the barbecue and especially dipped in the ranch sauce they provide you with- it's heavenly to say the least! By the time you're done with the wings, you're so hungry for more that even the celery sticks start looking delicious . The wings are well cooked, they are made fresh and you can tell by the texture of the wing. If the wing looks as if the skin has sulked into the bone, it means that the wing has been out for a time and has been dried out of its freshness. This is not the case with Buff Joe's!! Also, like Buffalo Wild Wings and a tendency to not put enough sauce on its servings and that's also not the case with Buff Joe's, the wings are covered in the sauce and they are not stingy on the sauce either! I would highly recommend getting a side of cheese fries with the wings. You can get an order of twenty wings for about $16.00 and believe me, it's enough for three women to eat. Also ask in advance how much the total is if you're ordering because they only take cash!"
"About a 2-2.5: Buffalo Joe's is an NU institution; this place is opened late, and they are known for their buffalo wings and chips (waffle fries).  I usually get the Suicide Wings, extra well-done, with a side of cheddar chips.  The sauce is more tangy and saucy, rather than spicy (there are slices of jalapenos on top to give it that 'kick').  There is a consistency problem with the size of the wings, as the size has decreased tremendously; in addition, the taste of the wings can alternate being saucy and tangy or tasting like ammonia (!!!).  Make sure you request for fresh chips (waffle fries), as when it gets cold, you can't appreciate the thick powdery cheese sauce that comes on top (it's thick, creamy, and salty; this can also fluctuate in being a little less thick)!  I love that they have RC Cola, which is quite refreshing.  The tables are sticky, and the place is not the most clean and sanitary-friendly (the bathroom is another whole mess :O  Also, keep in mind that they only accept cash.+Cheddar Chips+Suicide Wings (extra well-done)+cash only+sticky tables T___T+metered parking"
"Wings and buffalo chips are good.  Husband and I get a double order and that's more than enough to share.  Kids got a cheeseburger but we're not big fans of it.  They use a cheese type spread that my boys didn't really care for.  Cash only and lines are long but moves fast.  There's seating available in the back but it can definitely get crowded.  It's been a family favorite for years; now that we no longer live in Chicago, we still make an effort to visit  this place whenever we're in town."
I have frequented Buffalo Joe's many times over the years. Their food was always fantastic. My go to order is the suicide wings. They are unbelievable!. Hands down the best hot buffalo wings I've had!They serve seasoned waffle fries instead of traditional cut. They are awesome. The Burgers and Chicken sandwiches are good also. I cannot wait to go back.
"The food was good, but my mom and I didn't appreciate the service. We LOVE wings and drove 20 miles to get here. We came here on a Friday 15min after open. When we were ordering the young female cashier was impatient w/ us and clearly wanted to be somewhere else. My mom asked her what types of soda they have and she turned around and looked over at another worker and laughed out loud about some inside joke they had. Were they laughing at us? I don't know..  We waited for her patiently and when she turned back around she said ""yeah?"" and my mom repeated the question. It was as if we were interrupting her with our presence. During our meal, we see her walking around the restaurant on her phone. She was SO DISTRACTED by her phone that she was holding food and txting in the middle of a pathway to the bathroom that my my was on her way to. My mom, who has trouble walking, politely said ""excuse me"" and without a word, the cashier moved closer to the wall and proceeded to keep txting on her phone. She did not look up once. So incredibly rude. I wish my memories of coming to Buffalo Joe's in high school were relived today, but unfortunately that did not happen. If you can get past the customer service, their food is good. With the way my mom and I were treated, it left a bad taste in my mouth."
"This place fell off big time!!! I went here order a double order of suicide! Chicken was completely way over cooked like beef jerky. I told the owner (white guy with long hair) and he told me did you order it well done. I said, why would I order chicken well done. I've been here for the pass 15 years. It's worst everytime now. He changed my order and gave me 8 bigger drum pieces and 2 flats! Smh ‍ all the workers was looking at him and gave me a weird look too."
"This place has slowly declined in quality over the years.  At one point it was my favorite date spot.  Now, it's just angry people making mediocre food.  My fries were cold, wings were tiny, and the food was just kinda meh.  I've been going to Crisp instead.  The decline makes me sad."
"Buffalo Joe's is one of the best tasting fried wings places North of Chicago.  The food has been consistently good for the last 8 years.  They have 2 locations but I think this one is the better tasting and convient location.  There have been points where I was eating here several times a week. I continue to eat there despite the well known downsides.  First, they are cash only and because of that there is always at least one person, and as many as 7 men sitting on the steps next door, asking for spare change.  At first I would give them some change until they started commenting on my date, cat calling, or comment on my relationship thinking that would somehow encourage me to give them money.  It's as toxic and as uncomfortable as you can expect from a group of guys hanging out and trying to get your attention.Once you get inside, you meet a staff that is food first, customer relationship second, and building maintenance third.  In fairness, this place is always busy.  There is always a line that is moving very fast.  I've seen the staff deal with tons of people quickly in a constant and unending flow... Some of them are drunk, rude, scammers, and many that may have just been hollered at by a group of guys 30 seconds prior.  I can understand that dealing with ugly people constantly, all day, every day, in a hot, fast paced atmosphere could make you jaded.  I've seen many conversations turn dark quickly.  It's never happened to me but I think that the accuracy and quality of your order is impacted by your first interaction and unwritten rules.  i.e order a double order suicide wings, question why it only comes with one sauce, ask about the cost of a second, ask about the ATM fee, and a request a free glass of water; instead you get mild wings.  Order suicide and a bottle of water, get suicide.  Ya... It's a thing, it's not right, it's not how to run a business, and it seems totally arbitrary/petty unless you sit for 30 minutes and hear the same heated conversation a few times.How to have a positive experience:Come in, know what you want, order it quickly, ask for a *bottle* of water and/or RC cola, get your cash from the ATM, wait for your food, pay quickly, eat, chat with your friends, use a moist towelette, exit, then go right as you leave, and finally wash your hands at home.How to have a negative experience:Take you time ordering, discuss the cost of extra dipping sauce, ask for a free glass of water, mention any comments from social media, don't listen for your name, dig around for your money at the register, not have enough cash to pay, ask if they accept credit cards, mention the ATM fee, forget towelettes at the register, use the men's room, and the go left when you exit.I've seen first hand or experienced each of these unwritten mistakes and it didn't go amazing.Despite the downsides and weirdness, I continue to go back."
Do not eat their food.  You will become addicted and then I will have to wait in line behind you.Cash only.  Mild is a friendly hot.This place is worth a ride up on the purple line.
Shortest review ever! BJ's is the Best. SO how come only 4 stars?They need to enter the 21st century and get a credit card machine!
What can I say? I've been eating here since I was in 7th grade. It has never disappointed. The customer service is not the best but it evens out with the delicious wings. Let's just say the employees are true to character and just leave it at that. Always bring cash! The buffalo or bbq sauce is always on point here.
Whenever I'm in Chicago I would always come by and order. Normally order party pack to bring home to AZ. Love the lady in the cashier.. she mild manner and smiles and very welcoming.  the tray is packed full with chicken wings and it's sauce.. I don't mind bringing these awesome flavorful wings to Arizona.
Disgusting. Not sanitary. The cooks touch everything including your food. Is there a health inspector in Evanston? Thanks for the fake cheese!
If you're from the Northside of Chicago you know where to get wings. Buffalo Joes has always been around. You can get your wings pretty quick and get to your game you want to watch. Can never go wrong with Buffalo Joes!
"I can never say anything bad about BJ's food because I will travel far and wide for a single order & cheddar chips. BUT they're customer service must vastly improve. Those young woman are shameful, disrespectful, and have terrible manners. It's truly embarrassing to see. Not to have working phones during a pandemic is ridiculous!"
The best wings in cook county!!! It's just something about that sauce that has you sucking on your fingers lol
"I've had Buffalo Joe's about 2-3 times now and the last time I went I left a little disappointed. Had a single order of wings, hot, and the size of the wings I received were very small, some not even the length of one of my fingers. Small wings, not a lot of meat on them, it was disappointing. The first time I went I was pretty happy with the quality, so seems like it could be hit or miss. The overall quality of the restaurant could be better too, not the cleanest. Can't say for sure when I'll be back."
Visited this place after all the hype. The wings weren't bad. It was your original type sauces that you can get at at any bar. It is how ever cheaper than you hooters or wings stop places. Not bad though if you are just craving wings. I'd come back just for a fix.
"This is my fave place for chicken wings. I just wish it was closer to home. If you're not into tangy Buffalo wings (like me), I suggest you get the mild ones. Don't forget to order their cheesy waffle fries, they go so well with the wings. I always try to take my out-of-town-friends whenever they visit me and so far, it doesn't disappoint."
"I agree with other reviewers on so many things. Yes the wings have gotten smaller, you can't get a cup of water...have to buy bottles now, and sometimes the fries have a weird taste from the fryer.  With all that being said I can't stop going here for the wings! The amazing suicide wings smothered in that vinegary spicy heavenly sauce. So I go, cash in hand. An order of suicide wings and a beer instead! If anything  give the wings a shot and judge for yourself. Just bring a water bottle if you don't want to pay a dollar for their's."
"Best ever. Even though the wings can be small, you can't beat their suicide sauce, yeeeeeeeeesss!!!! Try their buffalo chicken sandwich! You need to."
Ordered $80 worth of food to sit there and wait for 2 hours. The cheese was stale and nasty. I had missing food and was accusing of stealing food after asking them for the rest of my order. ( They didn't believe me when I told them I was missing some of my food ) Recommended by a friend but never again. If I could put negative stars I would.
"Had to try buffalo Joe's when in the area. The spicy wings definitely hit the spot, although they're not my absolute favorite in the city. Next time I'll get some chips and possibly go for the suicide wings. Aside from the wings, I love the atmosphere. It really takes you out of the city feel and makes you feel like you just found a special wing place that no one else knows about."
Best place in Evanston/Chicago for wings.Order the suicide (it's not too spicy) with chips. I always have to eat this when I'm back in Evanston.
"I've been coming here for 20 years and I always get a double order of suicide wings. Sauce has always been great. Unfortunately the wings are pretty small. Thankfully you get so many that it's still a filling meal. They have hard to find pop choices (RC Cola, Nehi) The cheese fries are on point, pretty sure they use Merkts Cheddar. Had a cookie for the first time yesterday, so good, and so fresh the chocolate chips were still gooey. Would love to give this place a 5 star review but the size of the wings makes me downgrade to 4. Also just as a note, they only take cash."
"Best wings in the world, and you can wash it down with an RC Cola. Possibly my last meal if I was about to walk the plank."
"Cash only, but priced pretty reasonably and with good wings.  The Chicago style dogs?  Perhaps a bit overloaded, with weak buns that will collapse less than 1/3 into enjoying it.  Just roll with it, it'll still be good, but not the best dog in town by a long shot.  This is a wing place."
"My husband & I lived in Evanston for many years and we always loved Buff Joe's. Today I was passing through and decided to pick up a couple things as a treat. First, they aren't letting people in b/c of Covid, which is fine, but there isn't much direction obvious on how to order. A worker came outside and told me she could take my order, so I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and an order of suicide wings. Got home and we were excited to dig in but unfortunately, it seems the quality has gone way down. The first bite of the chicken sandwich was awful. The chicken was...crunchy. And not the good ""crunchy on the outside tender on the inside"". Like, the meat was crunchy. It felt like they'd fried a frozen chicken breast, which is fine, but not cooked it long enough or something. So that went in the trash. The wings were ok, not bad, not great, but ok. I definitely noticed what some other people have which is that they are SMALL. Like half the size of what I remember. I'm not sure if it was an off day or what but it was a real bummer as I remembered this place as being much better than it was today."
"I've been here once in my life, and everyone i know judged me for only going once in my lifetime. If you like wings, apparently Buffalo Joe's is the spot to be.. my fiance and his friends come once a week and literally crave it daily. I don't like wings that much (sorry!!!) so I went in for the chicken sandwich, which was to dieee for! The cheese fries lifted my soul and made my taste buds dance. The food was phenomenal, but I do have some gripes!It's really dirty. Which I understand, that's how the place has always been from what I hear and it's normal and people still come but I mean, a quick sweep and a hot towel on the table would do WONDERS for this place.Secondly, one man that works there is TERRIBLE to his workers! I felt so bad, he was yelling at a young guy who was clearly confused in front of everyone. Rolling his eyes, asking if he knows how to do anything right. It was uncomfortable and I don't think that should ever be tolerated. Pull him in the back if you have an issue and handle it like a civilized person. No need to embarrass the young man!"
I've been coming to this restaurant for many years since I was a little kid this place is a hole in the wall as in this place needs to be renovated soon the food is pretty good but the wings are very tiny. The sauces are really good. I would definitely recommend to buy your wings somewhere else and purchase the sauce here the experience would be the same. The reason I would doc the reason I would doc 1 star is because this place needs renovation it is so old that it smells inside. The food tastes so good but the stench smell so bad. One time I went and it smelled like bleach from the bathroom so now you're eating with the stench of bleach.
"Having had the opportunity to eat at some of the best wing joints in the US, I was sorely disappointed in the food, cleanliness, customer service, and overall first  impression of Buffalo Joes. The wings were soggy, swimming in a gag-inducing mild sauce, and fatty.  I am so used to grilled, crispy/charred, or at least baked crisp and not soggy wings. Mother Pluckers throughout Texas is a good example of awesome wings. Spending a few days shadowing that Texas institution might serve the ownership of Buffalo Joes well. I doubt if I will ever go back to BJs again. Regardless of the reviews, it's prima facie evidence that the fans and locals have limited experience in what a good wing tastes like."
"We went here to grab a bite and catch an NFL playoff game.  Buffalo Joe's came through with some DELICIOUS wings and a TELEVISION!  Very popular spot, and now I know why.  If you're thinking wings, think Buffalo Joe's!"
"This was the place to go growing up, and friends from out of town always wanted to eat here as well. Recently, not so much. Their quality has gone DOWN. The buffalo wings, which they're known for, are now tiny with hardly any meat on them. Very disappointing. (I also like Bleu cheese dip and both carrots and celery on the side;  Buffalo Joe's only serves ranch and celery.) My daughter ordered a burger and not only was it burnt, but it was much more bun than burger. They also use the sharp cheddar Merkdt cheese which is clumpy and has a far too pungent taste for a kid. What's wrong with regular sliced cheese?Their waffle fries are good, but those alone aren't worth the trip here anymore. There are other items on the menu, yet I always came for the wings!!"
"This place was so good.. will definitely go back. They should probably start taking card though, especially for people from out of town that don't know it's cash only"
"SO GOOD. I always prefer boneless, but I have to admit that their bone in wings are better than any wings I've ever had. So crunchy and saucy! I love how they have waffle fries because I love waffle fries. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because the facility is not that good looking."
"Wings were good! What can I say. Had a good time here w the homies, when I payed, I thought my order of wings was gonna come w fries atleast, but no. Only wings for the price"
"Wings are very good. I like that they use the small wings rather than the standard jumbo most all other food service operations use.Hot needs to be hotter. Mild needs to be more tangy. BBQ is solid.Prices are fair.However, as a restaurant owner and a someone who eats out a lot, i have a problem with a owner who has made millions out of here, owns the building and land, and yet doesnt re-invest a dime into his business. This place looks the way it does in 1991 only dirtier. Bottom line, its a dump in there and would prevent me from coming here regularly."
"Leave your standards and decency at the door and enjoy yourself. This is the best disgusting food you're going to find in Evanston... and it is real good. Everything fried. Everything delicious. My partner doesn't love it because they don't have much variety as far as sauces go... but I like places that do one thing perfect. And their buffalo wings and waffle fries ARE perfect. No, they're not nice to you. No, nothing looks like it's been cleaned in five years. No, there is no ambience. Yes, they'll send you to fried food heaven. Just make sure there's pepto on hand. Bring Cash. Your credit is no good here."
Born and raised in the town so there is nothing bad I can say about Buffalo Joe's. I prefer my wings cooked hard with extra sauce. I love their mild sauce! Buffalo Joe's is an Evanston staple and right of passage.
Love the suicide wings not spicy like I expected at all but still good. I wish you could get your double order with atleast 2 mixed flavors instead of ordering two different orders. They bbq flavor was great too
"Would probably be a really good place for wings if their sauce wasn't so sour and the chickens they use aren't so scrawny. We got the spicy and suicide sauce, but the sauce was more sour than spicy. It was so overwhelming that I eventually had to blot in a napkin before eating it. Suicide is essentially spicy sauce with jalapeños. If you prefer the sour taste of buffalo sauce though, it is the place for you! Their single portion is very generous--around 12 wings for $8. Make sure you bring cash because this place is cash only!!"
"The BEST wings around. Get their mild sauce on the wings. It's class buff joes. Also, cash only!"
Best Hot Wings Ever !!! Finger Licking Good !!I Drive From The Westside Of Chicago To Get These Wings If You Love  Hot Wings Try The SuicideIt is The Bomb.comThe BBQ Are Good Also
"If you don't mind the absolutely terrible service and the rude people behind the counter, Buffalo Joe's has some of the best wings I've ever had. I've also had the chili, which is decent--too many beans for my liking. I don't think I will come back because of the customer service (and the recent cockroach sighting! ) I don't usually enjoy getting ignored when wanting to place an order or yelled at while grabbing my tray of food. I quote, ""Did I say you could take that one?! Why don't you ask first!"" Yeah, like I said. No thanks."
"I've heard people rave about this place so when I discovered that I was only 5 minutes away and I was hungry I thought it was the perfect chance to try this place. I ordered the mild wings, I think I got 12. I was surprised how quickly the wings were ready. So I grabbed them and a seat and was ready. I was a little disappointed at the size of the wings. There wasn't a lot of meat on the wings. I stuck my finger in and really liked the mild. Usually mild means no flavor but not here. Their mild did have flavor and was pretty good. I finished the wings, I was still a little hungry when I left but didn't want to eat any more. The wings were delicious but again the amount of meat on the wings was a little disappointing. But I would go back.The place looks like an older hotdog/hamburger/Italian beef place (I think they also sell those items there as well). Lots of younger, older and people my age, right in the middle. Overall I enjoyed my experience."
"My cousin has been raving about this place for a while, so I knew I just had to check it out.  And, of course, those who recommend places always have to come with me.  So, off to Buffalo Joe's we go!  We ended up ordering a single and double order to split between 3 people which was the perfect amount with a side of Buffalo chips(waffle fries). My cousin and his wife recommended to get the wings well-done with extra sauce.  Which was a great recommendation!  The sauce is like no other buffalo sauce that I've tried before.  It's a creamy, buttery sauce with a hint of vinegar.  And, getting the wings well-done was great too if you love crispier wings.  The wings here are a bit smaller than the average sized wings, but I guess more sauce to chicken ratio.  The buffalo chips were a little bit crispier for my taste, but it seemed that the buffalo chips aren't always that crispy.      But, I highly recommend this place!  And, I'll most likely be back here within the next 2-3 weeks."
"I was huge fan of buffalo joes before. Unfortunately, the quality of the meat has declined. The chicken wings do not contain any meat. It's just bones and sauce. I went twice in one month and it was the same issue both times. I still enjoy the taste of the sauce and waffles fries but I'm not vegetarian. I want meat on my wings!"
"It's hard to find decent priced food these days, especially wings. Get it here because you will not find many other affordable options anywhere else. The sauces here are solid too. I had both hot and barbecue along with some rib tips plus the usual celery and ranch on the side. I would give the wings a 7.7 out of 10"
"I usually drive about 40 minutes for the wings. The kids and i usually order double suicide with fries. You could mix it with the bbq too. I havent tried anything else because i love their spicy wings. Staffs arent the greatest but they get the job done and i get my good. This place also serves beer. Affordable.. and i prefer the wings herw over most places, hence the 40 min drive."
"I don't get it.I know that the reviews are overall very good, but this place has not only failed to impress me on multiple occasions, but also it has been bad.Substandard service and overpriced, mediocre food."
The best wings don't mess around. You have to get them suicide in a tub of ranch and a order of fries so delicious love this restaurant been going hear so many years!!
"Food = 4 starsService = 2 starsOrganization = .5 starWe used to eat here at least monthly in college -- but that was 30 years ago. Now I work a couple of blocks away and have ordered from here twice in the last 6 months. Some things are the same as long ago: Amazing wings & burgers; cash only. Some things, through the eyes of a middled-aged adult, have changed: Do not order take-out via phone thinking it will make your life more efficient. Both times I have ordered by phone, they have called me back about 10 minutes later to ask me questions about my order while I was now standing in line at the restaurant (having been told 5 minutes). This last time, not only did they have questions but they then misplaced the piece of paper with my order. There's seems to be a great deal of disorganization behind the counter. I lost 40 minutes of my lunch hour trying to acquire my lunch. So, don't call: Just go in and stand in line; you'll be better off."
Completely unorganized order get here still have to wait in a line outside of restaurant. They check out one person at a time
"Buff Joe's is by far the best place in Chicago (yes, I know they're in Evanston), hands down to get chicken wings. The size of the wings aren't monstrously huge and the sauce is out of this world. Seriously, the sauce is on whole different level. You can also buy the signature suicide sauce so you can make wings at home, but it's always worth the drive up north. It will take a lot to sway my thoughts on this fine establishment. @wethefoods"
"TERRIBLE wings.  I can't even BELIEVE people--anyone--would recommend them.  They're TERRIBLE, disgusting.  Some of you people who think they're great must be on some pretty heavy drugs.The sauce tastes like ketchup with a little hot sauce.  It's very strange...  And there's WAY too much sauce.  It's like eating gobbly gook.They're the SMALLEST WINGS on earth!!!   Don't take my word for it:  I took pictures... One next to a quarter: THE QUARTER IS WIDER THAN THEIR FREAKING WINGS!  (and it wasn't just this one wing, they were all that small).  I posted them under the business pictures.   How can a wing place find such small wings to serve?  Are they aborted chickens, or chicks?  Are they even chickens? Their spicy wings aren't even hot... then they have ""suicide"" wings where they're not really any hotter--they just douse them in more sauce--AND ADD GIARDINARE.  how disgusting!!!  (it might be good drunk food or something, but don't call them buffalo wings)THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE BLUE CHEESE!!!  I suppose asking for carrots to go with celery (like you'd get in... Buffalo) would be totally out of the question if they're too cheap to even stock blue cheese!    This place shouldn't be allowed to associate itself with wings OR Buffalo, let alone both.  The staff wasn't very friendly... I was trying to read the menu and got rushed into ordering.  Once we sat down, we overheard a group of people arguing on the other side of the eating area... not just arguing, but standing up shouting in each other faces, ready to punch arguing...  the kind of thing where you debated if you should get up and leave, or get ready to dial 911.    guess who it was?  the staff. The *only* redeeming thing about this place was the waffle fries... they were pretty darn good.They weren't exactly cheap... An order of wings, waffle fries w/ cheese, and two drinks came out to be $17.  I want my $17 back.  Really.  They were that bad.It was one of those meals where you sat and debated if you wanted to finish, or if you would just abort and go elsewhere... we ended up eating more later I'm pretty sure.I've had better wings at Applebee's.  If you think the wings here are the best ever, you're really missing out."
"Famed and acclaimed, Buffalo Joe's is an anchor in Evanston and a primary contributor to the Northwestern freshman 15. You'll hear tales of its wonder and glory from all over but sometimes you just have to see it to believe it.I've made a few trips to Buffalo Joe's over the years and never counted it as a legendary wing....until now. On the latest edition of Get Yo Wing On, I waited in line and a brilliant idea came to my head, what if I ordered Buffalo Joe's wings extra well done?!  Extra well done? Hell yes they made me a batch!!!The wait is comedic, you'll see people running off with their score with trays filled to the brim with wings, cheddar waffle fries, and the All-American celery with batches of ranch and bleu cheese. Lacking the glitz and glamour of fancier trappings, you'll find Buffalo Joe's with the charm of any greasy spoon you'll find across America sprinkled with a tinge of intoxicating wing aroma.The concept is simple: freshly cooked wings laced with some of the best wing sauces you'll find in the city. Wings come in mild, spicy, BBQ, and if they like you they'll make some spicy BBQ. More spice-addicted souls can try their suicide wings laced with jalapenos but your ears might be left blowing out billows of smoke! These wings are lilliputian in stature but what they lack in size they compensate with volume and honest to goodness flavor.I've always found the wing sauce exceptionally delicious with a little extra kick to leave your mouth watering but veritably, I find myself a texture freak. I love texture on my food so when I got my wings extra well done and brought it back to the table my eyes lit up. The first bite was the best bite as I finally figured out the puzzle and unlocked the greatness of Buffalo Joe's at last. Extra well done means extra tasty crispy to the beat of my drum. You're going to find yourself wanting to come back for another visit to this Evanston wingery, and you just have to figure out what wing is best for you, but don't let me be the judge - take a bite out that for yourself!"
"tl;dr: god i love this restaurant so muchIts been over 2 years since I left Evanston, and I still get sad when I think about Buff Joe's. And how far away it is. And how I haven't found a buffalo wing quite as good. As some have mentioned, the wings are small, which is awesome. You get more sauce and crispy crunch per wing, and there are a lot of wings packed into the little paper tray thing. I usually go for mild for less burn and more chickeny flavor, but if I needed an extra kick, spicy was still doable. Was. God I miss it so much. I miss the fries too. ""Buffalo chips,"" but really waffle fries. Very crispy with a mysterious seasoning that is too good to question. I also miss the cashier and her long acrylic nails. And the feeling of anticipation while waiting on the stools for your order to be ready. And the weird vegetable art in the dining area. I'll be back for you someday, Buff Joe's."
They're are known for their sauce on their wings but I highly recommend to try their sauce on their chicken tenders. I'm a huge fan of their mild sauce.  Don't forget the ranch lol.. cheers!
"What a bizarre place.  So they call it ""Buffalo"" Joe's.  That's offensive, in my opinion, being a native Buffalonian (I know you love the way that rolls off the tongue).  If you're expecting real buffalo wings, this joint sucks.  Period. Skimpy, nasty, sweet, weird wings without blue cheese.  That's what comes to my mind now when I think of Buffalo Joe's. Upon entering the rude staff rushed me into ordering and looked at me like I was insane when I asked for blue cheese with my wings.  This is when I knew we were in trouble, but we had read good reviews of the place so we figured it was worth a try.  The order taking employee told me ""they good, you should try them"" so, with this ringing endorsement, Dane and I ordered a double order and some waffle fries.  I think we ordered them mild but I can't remember because I'm still trying to wash the memory from my mind.  Somewhere around this point, I saw the most offensive thing of all - giardiniera on top of a pile of the tiniest wings I've ever seen.  Luckily, this monstrosity wasn't ours, but the next order to come out was.  The first thing I noticed was the color and excessive quantity of sauce.  They looked the color of spaghetti sauce and had were drowned in sauce.  The waffle fries looked good (and they were, but deep fried toe jam would have tasted good compared to these wings). Upon arriving at our table, we took the plunge and tasted these tiny, tiny wings.  They were so small that we actually had to take a break from eating to laugh about it.  We compared the largest wing to a quarter and found the quarter to be wider (see photos uploaded by dane k.).  The sauce was sweet and ketchupy.  It was at this point when we decided we should consider cutting our losses, dumping the wings in the trash can and finding some real wings but the scary dining room entertainment was too interesting to abandon.  I can't stress enough how tiny the wings were.  Most of the drumettes, at the big end, were narrower than my thumbnail.  Seriously. It was like they were actually pigeon wings.  Maybe guinea hens.  I'm not sure. Around this time a table started getting loud, every other word being an obscenity (*I* was uncomfortable and I have a mouth like a sailor -- and there were several families with children present).  Next thing you know someone threw a tray onto the table and yelled ""I told you I'd give you your f-ing money"" and there was a verbal exchange that actually scared some people out of the restaurant.  As it turns out, this was a table of employees on their break.  Nice. I'm from Buffalo and admittedly a tough wing critic; however, these are without a doubt, no question about it, the worst attempt at wings I've EVER tasted. That's a pretty tough distinction to achieve because I've had some really nasty wings.  These certainly take the cake. Calling this place ""Buffalo Joe's"" is false advertising.  I hereby make a motion to rename it to ""Joe's Ketchupy Pigeon Wing Emporioum"" or something along those lines."
"The best chicken  wings I had. try mild sauce  also the cheddar  chip was also great . The price is kind d of high for the serving .well does it matter if u love the food, at least I stop by every month that is how I love their wings"
"great wings and amazing waffle fries. Although, if you order from here, make sure you are prepared to be treated with disrespect...."
"I'm not even a huge wing person but these are the best wings ever, period. I usually get spicy. The flavor and texture are perfect. The fries are AMAZING especially with ranch. Never had better wings"
"Not really a picky wing-eater, and I'm good with their sauces. The wings are kind of small though compared to other places nearby, and I prefer the big and juicy ones with meat.Don't be surprised by poor customer service here."
"Probably the closest yet I have come to what I would imagine they intended buffalo wings to be.  Buff Joes has to be on my top...3 of wings destinations.  I was intro-ed to said wings several years ago in my high school years.  I still feel like Im cutting class when I sit down to eat over there.  So anywho..why I am writing a review now?  Because I have never attempted to tackle a party platter in one sitting....till now.  I speak of the $40 platter thats supposed to serve 8-12 people I believe?  I have no idea what possessed my friends and I (yes! grammar skills) to attempt to tackle such a feat.  Let me just clarify I speak of 4 people for this platter of glory.  This stint of gluttony was the brain child of pure spontaneity and opportunity.  4 people, $40...how could you go wrong??About 45minutes later..me and my partner in crime inhaled about low-mid 30s each.  The 2 others wimped out and had about 10-15 each.  A late comer came into the equation contributing another 10-15.  In the conclusion of this session of man v food.....Food came out victorious...there was about 12 wings left.  Think about that for a sec..that is a massive amount of wings!  And let me tell you..grease, and spice.......youre just asking for it.  A dastardly duo of disaster; definitely!  They device a fiendish evac.  Regardless of what is left on the plate after any gluttony bout...trust me, FOOD ALWAYS COME OUT ON TOP."
Their wings are good - close to real good.Their waffle fries are good - also close to real good.Their service is typically horrific and it's really expensive for what you get.
Ordered the order of double wings mild with waffle cut fries. Best wings in Evanston!!!!
I haven't been here in yearsssss. And I must say I was disappointed. Wings shrank and the flavor was ok. Sad to say the place was pretty filthy.  We arrived after 1:00 this afternoon.  And seemed the lunch rush was done but they didn't clean up after them.  My friend that's a guy said the bathroom was no bueno filthy! Oh well. I'll go back if I'm ever in the area. But I'll be ordering it to go...
"Everyone seems to rave about their wings and honestly, I thought they were pretty decent. But their burger (or at least the one I had- their bacon cheddar burger) was far from being a decent eat. It was soggy, and the bun fell apart in the middle of my first bite. My burger patty slid out along with majority of the content and that is a huge no-no for me! If wings was the only thing they made, then I would definitely give this place a 3.5/5 rating, but everything else definitely brings this place down. They only accept cash, so please make sure you have cash with you. Nowhere on their website do they mention that, but they do when they are taking your order down. Another huge pet peeve- I haven't seen them wearing gloves when preparing my food. There was a lot of hand and celery contact that made me queasy."
Best wings in Chicago or Evanston.  Wherever you want to say this place is at.  Best dish - suicide wings.  It's just their regular wings with jalapenos.
I've went to see how special their chicken wings where and it was great. The wings where small itself but they did give a nice portion.
"Wings that I could literally eat until I burst. Same with the waffle fries. A single order ($8.50) is about 20 wings total. I went with the mild version and thought the sauce was absolutely heavenly and unlike any other I'd had before. Looked like there was a lot of seating inside, but I got my order to go. Cash only. The times I went, there was usually a homeless person near the door, probably assuming most people would be coming out with spare change."
Still loving Buf Joes as the wife and I continue visit on a frequent basis. Remember to ask for well done if you like your wings crispy
"By far the best buffalo wings you'll ever have!  Went there recently and found out that you could have the wings well done (CRISPY!!!)  It's funny, back when I was in high school, I would always get the hottest they served (suicide).  Later in college and thereafter, I would get the ""hot"" flavor.  Just about a couple years ago, I switched over to the mild flavor.  Either way you go, any and all flavors would not disappoint you!  Oh, for all of you who don't like buffalo sauce, they also have a great bbq sauce too.  Don't forget to get your buffalo chips (waffle fries) as well!CASH ONLY!!!"
This is like my go to place for wings when I am in Evanston. They wings are small but that's how I love them. The have a nice crunch and juiciness to them. The sauce is good and the waffle fries are amazing. The only bad thing is the don't have blue cheese but it doesn't stop me from coming.
"These are some of the worst wings I've had in my life.The wings are lightly battered, which I usually like but they don't have a good crisp that you expect from wings. They are also quite small.Sauces, I tried original, bbq, buffalo. I generally don't like sauces on my wings so I might not be the best person to judge this but the bbq sauce is overly sweet and the buffalo sauce smells and taste like the poor quality pepper sauce that people used 15 years ago when buffalo wings started to get famous.I got cheese waffle fries and chili waffle fries as well. The cheese is the typical cheap american cheese that resembles cheeze whiz (uncomfortably salty). It's just dropped onto the fries. The chilli, also just plopped onto the fries is not that great either. Service is not that great either but that's expected.I don't expect each batch of chicken perfectly cooked, sauced, and presented onto a plate. This is a hole in the wall. But when your standard actually drops below the literal expectation of ""rundown diner"", you hit a problem."
My first time here and the wings were BANGINGGG!!!!! I'm coming back very soon like weekly
"Hands down, the best wings in the game. I love the mild and medium and usually get some waffle fries on the side. This place is so damn good and the staff is tip top."
The very best wings + fried chicken spot... I have yet to try anywhere else that can even try to stack up against Buffalo Joe's
"Always the go to for tasty wings!!! Like all the locals in the area, I have been a ""coming here since back in the day"" patron. The only thing that has changed since way back is my age, and I fear that I have become that ""angry old guy"" when it comes to things the current youth could most likely not care a thing about. Please for the love of god wipe down the customer areas!!! The sleeve of my coat just about permanently adhered to a table as I waited to pick up my food!"
"Small. That's what comes to mind now when I came here on a recent visit. BuJoe's used to be a staple of my adolescence. Splitting a party pan of 'Suicide' where it was so hot it looked like my friends and I had spent the day at the pool. A huge cup 'Gutbuster' size lemonade to wash it down and a tray of celery and ranch-you know for the healthy part of the meal.The wings now are small-just so tiny that it made me want to cry a little over the now former memories of big wings/drummettes that used to be the calling card here along with the 'Suicide' sauce which was so hot but now seems a little tame by comparison-maybe my taste buds are dying off in my old age but I think they are just using a weaker hot sauce.RIP Buffalo Joe, you're not what you used to be. I'll miss you."
"It's always fun to come here for a late night dinner with friends.  Unfortunately, I've noticed that their wings have gotten even smaller.  There was barely any meat and what meat there was on the bones were very tough.  The celery that came with our order was not washed well and I was so desperate to combat the saltiness of the wings with the celery that I ended up wiping the dirt off with the napkins.. but gross. The cheese fries were the only thing that made the meal yummy."
"I have been going here ever since highschool and it is still my all time favorite place for wings.  Wings are one of my favorite types of foods so there are times I stop by here multiple times a week.There are some times that the wings are small in size, but I go there so much that it usually balances out lol."
"Pains me to write this, ive been going to Buff Joes since 2005. Always recommended it to friends and family as the best!Well now 10 years later everything that made this place special was now making it worse.You walk in and the staff is all on their phones or yelling at eachother. The place has not been upgraded one bit nor cleaned in 10 years. The funky smells coming from the back kitchen could ruin your appatitte. The disgusting bathroom and sticky floors make you feel dirtier then when you walked into the bathroom so dont do it.What really changed was the prices, $24.50 for 1 large soda, two single orders of wings and 1 cheese fry. I could not beleive it, they raised the prices 20% in two years yet the wings are even smaller than I remember. The ranch is watered down and the Merkts cheddar has been replaced with a cheap substitute. The fry order was half what is used to be yet the price is near $4.I was embarrased and ashamed that a place that brought back such great memories was such a disaster now. My wife asked if it hit the spot and I said no and listed all the things above, she looked at me confused and said ""Really? Its always been like that, I thought thats why you go there"".I then realized that all my great memories were during my college years when sanitary, fairly priced, great customer service, dining experiences didnt matter as long as my stomach was full."
"Best wings anywhere so far.  Suicide well done double order.  BUT, they really have to get rid of the beggars out front of the business.  That deters some people."
Great taste and good people.  Best wings so far anywhere
"I used to come to this place all the time in high school and loved it. Today I was in the area and decided to revisit and I will never come back to this place again. I ordered food to go and wasn't able to eat it until later. I ordered a double order of wings and when I finally got home to eat them, we only had a single. When I called and let them know that they gave us a single they told us to come back which is a 20 min drive but we paid 20 dollars for it so I went back. When my friend and I talked to them about the problem they accused us of lying and eating the food. When I tried to explain why I could not come back sooner they continued to tell me I was lying and we're extremely rude about it. I will never step foot in that place again."
E towns is better than Rogers parks. if you want buff joes get it here first. double suicides are a way of life
"I been going to buffalo joes since I been a kid best wings I have ever ate and I have traveled and ate wings pretty much everywhere. But everything is good to the fried chicken buffloe sandwich  the clubs, the soup.  I never had the burger dont think I will. But I eat here at least twice a week. I usually get take away because its ugly and usually packed inside so kt kinda  stinks of collage kids in the summer. I'm lucky I live less then a block away."
"Buffalo Joe's is a classic!  The wings here are consistently juicy and tender.  In terms of sauce, they have a several options, but the best ones are mild and suicide.  Note: the suicide is actually not that spicy (by the name, you expect it to be crazy, but it doesn't even come close to the level of spiciness that Bdubs ranks some of their mid-high spice level sauces).  Skip the BBQ: just tastes like any other chicken wing covered in some sweet barbeque sause.  The other sauces are the ones that they're loved for and do best."
This place was featured in one of the articles for best wings in Chicago land area. The wings were cooked to perfection and were not too saucy or dried.
"Taste: 3.5Location: 4Cleanliness: 3.5Ambience: 3Value: 3.5Service: 3OVERALL = 3.5* Out of a 5-point scaleI got the Suicide Wings and Spicy Cheddar Waffle Fries (they call them Chips). The taste was pretty good, but for Suicide Wings, I expected something much spicier but was let down instead. Overall it still can't beat Buffalo Wild Wings flavors. I'd still recommend this though for anyone looking for Wings in downtown Evanston."
"If you are looking for some amazing wings, Buffalo Joes is the place to go! I've been going to Buffalo Joes for 15 years and I can still say that they, hands down, have the best wings in the Chicago-land area. Their sauce is definitely what makes the wings and it doesn't taste like only tobasco...like most other establishments. Mild, spicy or suicide are the levels of heat and you can order a single order, double order or a party pan if you're really hungry! I love to pair their wings with the buffalo chips or cheddar chips and a gutbuster (medium) lemonade or pop. Yes, pop...not soda! :) I like my wings a little crispy, so I order mine well done. Buffalo Joes is definitely a comfort food and I probably go once a week! :) They have many other items on the menu, but I can't say I have EVER tried anything else there. It just seems wrong. However, it is great that they have other options...which look yummy...in case you are with people who don't like wings. Although, I have NEVER met a person who doesn't LOVE Buffalo Joes! Even people who don't like wings end up loving Buffalo Joes! Buffalo Joes has a couple of locations, but the one in Evanston is the best. It does get crowded, especially when Northwestern has a game - but seats open up pretty quickly on a normal night. The only downside of the place is that it is cash only. So, make sure you come prepared. Your belly will definitely leave happy! :)"
"The more things change... the more they stay the same... mostly.Back in the day I would have had an order of Wings... suicide... a Cheddar Char Burger, Cheddar Char Chips and an RC Gut buster.  That was in my NU days... but on a recent visit back to Evanston, we made a late night run to our old, favorite haunt.  We went spicy with the Wings this time... and while they were good, they were not as good as we remembered... a little too fried and greasy, perhaps.  Hmm...We skipped the Chips (waffle fries) but went for a Burger, too.  That was even better than I remembered... So darn good... the juices from the meat soaked the cheese spread bun perfectly... mustard and ketchup... pickles, tomato and lettuce... Simple but stunningly delicious.  I can still taste it.  Mmmm!"
"this place is a north shore institution! you really cant go wrong a single order of wings. The prices are good- 9$ for a small which is 10-12 wings. the cheese fries here are really hit or miss. they use real cheese which is great, but I've also had the fries come out very soggy (so I usually skip on ordering a side of fries unless I am REALLY hungry or want to share with someone). Last time we ordered mild and our wings were really spicy which wasnt ideal. I ordered over the phone and they might have misheard me? Not going to fault buff joes for this one bc every other time I've ordered the spiciness level has been as i requested.The clark street location is open later than the green bay one, for all you midnight snackers! It is CASH ONLY."
Best wings in the area and in the top 3 I've ever had. Relatively quick service for such a busy place. Go during non-peak times.
"It's a sad day when you realize one of your favorite places is now a dump with bad service, expensive food and just overall a disappointment. Begs the question, have I changed or this place?  No, it's definitely this place.  This will be my final visit to buffalo Joe's. I urge all others to enjoy any one of the other 200+ restaurants in Evanston or any other Wing joint.  Good luck"
Oooh Buff Joes... My favorite place to eat in Evanston. The wangs are thee bomdiggidy and the cheese waffle fries. Mmm. Con: Kind of dirty and they don't accept cards. Oh well big whoop right? The best wings place for me so far.
"Wimpy wimpy sized wings, good overall sauce on wings with good flavor. Out dated dirty looking restaurant, horrible customer service. I asked for ranch and the du"
The wings are so delicious and the service is in a good timely i can't wait to swing back and try it again. I have the spicy wings
"I wasn't even hungry. I just came from the gym! But gosh darn it, you had me at waffle cheese fries.  I came in and got the ""small"" order of mild buffalo wings and cheddar waffle fries.  The waitress warned me that the cheese was ""different"" - mmmm!!!  The cheese is thick with flavor and I really thought it complimented the fries really well.  I'm ashamed how quickly I devoured them.  wait, no i'm not.  Anyway, the wings were pretty good. Nothing AMAZING but if you're looking for some good greasy comfort food then it's a good option. 3.5 stars."
"This is your prototypical college wing dive spot. They do have other choices on the menu but I have been coming only for the saucy bites for years now thanks to my wife who grew up on ""Buff Joe's"" suicide sauce and cheddar chips. A double serving of each topped with pickled jalapeños will keep you coming back for sure. Leave your plastic at home as this is a cash only spot."
"They have pretty standard chicken wings, but they're not outstanding. The sauce is a bit spicy (even the milder one) and tasted more like vinegar than sauce but I don't mind spicy so I still liked it. They were fast with my order, and I liked the gumbo, but it wasn't anything spectacular in my opinion. I would go again if I really had a craving for chicken wings, because it's close and they deliver, however, it wouldn't be at the top of my list of places to go."
"They have pretty standard chicken wings, and they're good! The sauce is a bit spicy (even the milder one) but I don't mind spicy so I liked it."
OH MY WORD.the wings hereareDELICIOUSUGHAS;LDIFAH;SLDIFHi always crave these thingsand thenGET SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY REALITYbecause... its a bit of a drive for me to get herebut just thinking about these wonderful heavenly saucy tastey oh not so little wingsgoodness gracious and theCHEDDAR CHIPSscrew dietsand if ur gonna cheatmight as well make it a WORTHY CHEATCOME TO BUFFALO JOESS!
"The food is good but I went there as my third choice for the night. The people outside were around but not harassing. I ordered and paid for a double order of mild wings and a cheese fry so 19.39 I got a single order of mild wings and plain fries. When I got home I called and was told we can give you a credit or a refund. This is a cash only place so as it stands I had to use the overpriced atm to get money to pay the bill.  I chose the credit, on the phone she said just give the manager when you come back your name and you'll get ""free food"". ..ok we will see if this actually works. I've been to this location dozens of times over the years, this is the first time I was cheated out of an order.  This is a serious offense.  I'll go back for my free food but I doubt I'd go back again."
"The truth is, they are, what they say they are a wings and burger place in downtown Evanston and a wings and ribs place on Howard street Chicago.  I have never been disappointed until this year.  The girl on the register ""flawless"" as always, the ribs were like they took all the good stuff home and were serving the customer scraps.  The 2 cooks in the back were so busy talking to each other that they literally didn't cook the food and there were about 4 people waiting and that number quickly built to a dozen since it was a Friday night.  The girl asked them a couple times and they gave her a look that said ""don't talk to us""  Wings were good but no celery or sauce was on the order, they must be taking that home as well.  Ive been coming here since they opened each of the resturants, I've recommended hundreds of people.  This was a real let down."
"I don't understand throes of you who praise Buffalo joes. This isn't even food.Seriously the wings are TERRIBLE. I got a burger once and it had cheese spread on it in place of a slice. The food makes my stomach turn. They dump salt on the fried like there's no tomorrow and the people who work there are delinquents. They're rude as fuck EVERY time I've gone there (which is about 4-5 until I officially wrote this dump off)People saying ""oh buff joes is great"" must either be on a masculinity overcompensation quest OR just incapable of tasting anything."
"The wings are very small, and are so easy to scoff down when you're in the mood. I've never eaten here and not been completely engrossed in what I was eating, and not been begging and not made an absolute mess. It tastes pretty great. But honestly, I don't really like going here. It's cash only, and there's an ATM there that costs like $5 to use. Also, it's a bit more taxing and underwhelming than Chicken Shack (if you do Chicken Shack right). So yeah, it's tasty and the sauces are great, but the chicken itself is not amazing tbh."
If you are craving hot and spicy chicken wings...you will be disappointed. The wing sauces: spicy and suicide have an odd flavor profile and frankly just does not taste good. The wings are small too. The cheese is fake and tastes like spoiled cheese whiz. The place is old and not clean. You have to pay in cash and pay for water. Workers don't seem to enjoy their job. There are better wing places out there. Don't waste your time coming all the way here.
"This was Sweetie's favorite wing place in Chicago, so I had to stop by on the way through last week.  Especially after she forbade me to stop at any BBQ places on the south side...Nice little college-town wing joint.  Looks really small, but once you order you see there's a bigger room in back to eat.  Service was efficient and friendly.  Order sizes are big-  I got a single and worried that it would be enough, but it was plenty.  Nice meaty wings, good sauce (I got BBQ.)  I got a side of celery, which was also good sized.  Between a few veggies, lots of wings, and some RC, I was fully satisfied.  Can't wait to go back."
"Food is just ok & price is reasonable, BUT The workers at the counter (girl that takes the order) when u walk in is sooooooo completely rude Making faces,Attitude and all !!! Even when she answered the phones!!!! Hey management hire some friendly staff to work ur counter!!!!"
"Really good food at a really good price. That is all. Went in there placed my order and realized it was cash only. The male server was really nice and understanding and told me there was an ATM machine that we could use. So I walk over to the ATM machine only to find that it's out of service. I go up to the female cashier and tell her I placed an order but I only have my credit card. She proceeds to say while rolling her eyes ""I don't know what to tell you, I mean you see that it's out of order so I don't know what you want me to tell you."" I was already going to go to a nearby ATM to get cash but her attitude almost made me want to walk out of there for good. Buff. Joes please hire kids that know how to talk to customers. Even though the main reason that business is thriving is because the food is good which means that her and her attitude are easily replaceable. With that being said she probably won't last for the next time I go there. Also, I placed my order exactly before a wave of people came in yet they all got their orders before mine. When I went to get cash I thought they called my name already so I waited patiently until I noticed that the same guy who took my order noticed my order wasn't done yet either. Once I moved closer to the register I noticed that the cashier and two of the servers were doing their friends orders first."
"I've been going here for years and born and raised in the area. Yes some people who work there are rude and yes it would be nice if it weren't just cash only but the food is good. People complain about how dirty it is only because the kitchen is right in front of you, you should see some kitchens and some really nice restaurants that are just as bad I've worked in a lot of kitchens. I find it interesting that people say the place is gross and dirty but still ate there .... If your going to complain about the kind of pop they have then don't drink it ... If you don't like there customer service maybe really realize this isn't fine dining but a hole in the wall wing place. Get over it or go somewhere else stop your bitching. Wing stop is up the street :)"
"The first disappointing experience at Buffalo Joe's in years! This place has never been close to me, but always worth the drive. Never mind what it looks like inside, the food has always kept me coming back. The first warning sign today was no more celery. They have swapped it out for carrots and it sounds like the carrots are here to stay. The wings were... different. No one eating lunch in the place had a single flat. All drumettes. They're bigger, but you get a smaller portion, and the meat just tastes... off. It's a sad day today at Buffalo Joe's! Hopefully my lifelong love affair with the place isn't over."
OMGGGG BEST PLACE TO GET WINGS EVERRRR!!! I come here a few times a month cause it's so yummmmy! The wings come out perfect every time and the ranch is delicious and the waffle fries are so good too! The whole combination is to die for SO SO GOOD! If you love wings you'll love buff Joe's
So good. Every time I come to Evanston I eat here with my family. They've been killer for decades. Wing sauce is to die for. Only take cash and have rc cola products. Get some wings with buffalo chips to soak up the extra sauce.
"I have been coming to buffalo Joes for a long time now. Sure, their wings have become much smaller. We can't do anything about it. On the bright side, their sauce hasn't changed one bit. The waffle fries are perfectly seasoned and piping hot and fresh. Back to these amazing wings. I am still proud of this place despite their ever shrinking wing size. Every time I have a friend from out of town, I take them here. The sauce makes it worth while. My friend loved the wings so much....i believe he moved here for them! (Maybe) The problem is the staff is on the rude side and they are really stingy on the ranch/ bleu Cheese. They do not take credit cards. The drinks (unless otherwise ordered) come heavily iced. The place is tiny and needs to desperately be remodeled and updated to 2009. The bathrooms are kinda clean. You would think I would give this place 3 stars considering the negatives I have for this place...right? WRONG. I love these wings so much that I will STILL, despite the negatives(which are pretty serious in most peoples books, give this place 4 stars. For 24 or so wings its $10 bucksFor 15 its like $7 Try them....make the trip... you won't regret or forget the adventure you and your taste buds go on.word to the wise: Check out the waffle fries (omg, that rhymes hahahaha)"
"The wings of the place is awesome! You won't find lots of flavors like you would at bw3, just mild, spicy, and suicide. The breading is not too much, but the crisp was perfect.===============================And now my signature bathroom review!===============================the place itself is kind of a hole in the wall. That being said, I didn't expect too much from it. And it's pretty much true. It's a place to take a leak, and then get the f out. So sit or squat? Squat... And flush the toilet by kicking the toilet handle down, because gawd knows what's touch that toilet handle"
"Yu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-ummmm!!Hands down best wings in Chicago.  You get about 15 or so wings for a single order. The wing sizes are on the small side, just like I like it. I want to eat wings not drumsticks. The sauce is what makes the wings. It perfectly coats the wings and is fantastic.I always get a single order with waffles fries and cheese on the side. Waffle fries are solid.  I recommend getting the cheese on the side. The cheese isn't liquidy nacho cheese, this cheese coagulates after a while and it's a nice compliment to the wings.Service is okay and the place isn't very tidy but this isn't fine dining, you come here because the wings are freaking delicious."
"Tried there super hot wings with jalapenos. Have become a fan of theirs eversince. Sauces have 3 levels of hot variations made in pure butter.Hind side, size of the wings are very small, but I think thats the reason they always throw in a few extra.If you are in mood for some spicy wings, then this is the place. Its a strictly pick up and go place, only to come back again!"
Party pans!  Haven't had B.J.'s in a year!  Still hasn't changed.  Still the best.  Eaten til cardiac arrest!  - Haha.  I made a rhyme!See the Party Pan pix!  They'll make you want some!
"Ok, so I'm back.  It's been a long time.  Nothing has changed.  The wings are as awesome as I remember.  Ranch over rice mixed with awesome wings and sauce!  Consistently awesome.  The intoxicating smell is still in my car..."
"This is a local favorite of mine for years living on the north side of Chicago.  As far as buffalo wings are concerned, this place is my favorite.  They do not boast different flavors ala wing stop, ""BW3's"" or other joints, but their buffalo wings are easily better.  They come in a variety of hotness (mild, hot, suicide).  I personally prefer the suicide wings.  It is basically a slightly hotter than hot version with jalepeno slices throughout.  As far as the type of wing, they are not battered like Hooters.  A simple wing with some kickin sauce is what really makes it good.   Sure, there are other items such as burgers / etc. on the menu, but the star of the show is the wings.   OK.  One thing to try if you are brave is.. now don't laugh...   Haha!  What I love to do is, get a ton of BJ's take out, make a pot of rice... and eat the wings with the rice and the ranch!  No joke.  I literally pour the ranch ON THE RICE!  I know it sounds crazy but I got my wife, my brother and maybe a cousin or two doing it now!  They initially thought I was nuts.  Now, it rutine!  Seriously!  (There is something about their ranch that goes well with the rice.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe it's the creamy / milky texture?)  I've tried other ranches and it just doesn't work!   Oh, and one thing to be aware of.  Parking is a pain.   It is located in an area that only has a small side street worth of parking.  Be prepared to either fight for a spot or have someone in the car with you to move the car if you get takeout.  Being it is right by Northwestern U, it can get really packed in there.  I usually get take out anyway.  Be sure to call ahead if ordering on the go.  Especially if ordering party pans.They also have one other location on Howard street by the Howard CTA station."
My boyfriend loves the wings here. If you want something super spicy then the jalapeño wings are the way to go.  I usually get the spicy with the fries and ranch. It's a favorite stop when we're in the area.
"Addictive wings.. One star taken off for lack of consistency of the sauce on the wing. Sometimes there isn't enough sauce and sometime, they're drenched in them. My mother in law loves these wings and that is a great compliment."
"For starters, I admit to being a wing snob. I generally don't touch anything outside of Frank's in Mundelein - the best wings outside of Buffalo, NY. I'm also not a college dude...not even close. You can probably guess where this is going.I don't mind the divey atmosphere. For a wing joint in Evanston, that's fine. Cash only? Okay - a throwback to the 90s. I can appreciate that. Crowds of bros saying the word ""bruh"" every 20-30 seconds? I can even manage that. But the wings...If you're honest with yourself, you know these wings are merely a step above Buffalo Wild Wings. If you've never had really amazing wings, this might lead you to believe that your search is over. Keep looking, friends. There is an entire world of wings out there for you to discover - many of which stand taller than these.My friend got a burger that was all bun. Classic ""where's the beef?"" scenario. He didn't have much to say other than that.The moment of redemption came when I tried the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. Now THAT made the trip worth it."
"I've eaten here so many times, but only now getting around to reviewing it.I love the wings here, but they can be very inconsistent. Sometimes your double order feels like a 1.5 order, sometimes the chicken they serve you is really dry, sometimes it's soggy.  However, they get it right more times than they get it wrong. And when they get it right, it's pure bliss.Some major downsides are that it's cash only and the service can be really bad sometimes.  The people taking your order seem to prioritize chit chatting with each other over taking your order.  There's an ATM inside the place where you can withdraw money, but of course there are fees for doing so.  The eating area also never feels ""clean enough""."
"I'm sorry to say.....after 30 plus years of going to Joes.....I'm done. The food is still good; however, the prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!Think about this.....a single order of wings are almost $9.00. Cheese fries almost $4.00. Big drink $2.00.  An order of 6 chicken strips (each strip small), close to $10.00!!!!! So in other words, wings, cheese fries and a drink with tax pushing $17.00....at a fast food place!!!!!  BTW....if u need water after your order of ""suicide wings"" it's now 22 cents; for water!!! No more.....thanks for the memories."
"I visited here late Thursday night. I was happy to find a restaurant that opened until midnight. Food was good especially souce. However the meat was slim on my chicken wing. Also, the cashier who i met was so unkind and made me feel very uncomfortable. Overall point was 2.5 stars due to that cashier."
Horrible customer service. I ordered the food way in advance it wasn't ready when I got there. Ordered regular fries I received waffle fries that were hardly cooked. Nasty. Never again
